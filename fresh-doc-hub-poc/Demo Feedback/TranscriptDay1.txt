0:0:7.36 --> 0:0:7.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:0:12.356 --> 0:0:15.516 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, so I have made all the modifications that we talked about yesterday. 

0:0:18.76 --> 0:0:18.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So. 

0:0:22.556 --> 0:0:28.556 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
For all the endpoints, I've added these two header parameters for the auditory tracking purpose. 

0:0:27.996 --> 0:0:29.556 
John Drum 
Speak up a little bit. Your voice is very soft. 

0:0:31.236 --> 0:0:35.196 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Uh, so I have added these two header parameters for all the requests. 

0:0:37.716 --> 0:0:39.236 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Uh, for the tracking purpose. 

0:0:40.996 --> 0:0:47.436 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And in the post request for templates, I got rid of the template version. Sorry. Yeah. 

0:0:45.196 --> 0:0:45.716 
John Drum 
What is? 

0:0:47.156 --> 0:0:48.756 
John Drum 
What is that ID for? 

0:0:47.476 --> 0:0:47.636 
Murali Naramamidi 
And. 

0:0:51.156 --> 0:0:54.196 
John Drum 
There's a trace ID, but what does that mean? 

0:0:52.36 --> 0:0:52.396 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
These two. 

0:0:58.276 --> 0:1:5.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So where the request is coming from? I mean, I just picked this parameters from document communication service that we're already using. 

0:1:8.716 --> 0:1:13.236 
John Drum 
I'm sorry, I can barely hear your voice. Maybe it's just me, but can you? 

0:1:14.476 --> 0:1:16.916 
John Drum 
Speak up a little louder. 

0:1:16.916 --> 0:1:17.836 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, just a second. 

0:2:5.996 --> 0:2:6.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Can you hear me now? 

0:2:6.796 --> 0:2:8.596 
John Drum 
Yes, much better. 

0:2:9.676 --> 0:2:9.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:2:12.716 --> 0:2:28.276 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, so I picked these two parameters from the document communication service. I'm really not sure exactly how we get these values and how do we use them. I was going to discuss with Taher later, but I just picked those two parameters. 

0:2:29.636 --> 0:2:32.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
From the other endpoints that we already have in place. 

0:2:31.76 --> 0:2:31.196 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:2:33.996 --> 0:2:40.356 
John Drum 
And that's great, except we don't want to add stuff that we don't know what they're actually for. Um. 

0:2:41.756 --> 0:2:46.36 
John Drum 
Because you're gonna have to add this to the data dictionary. 

0:2:47.676 --> 0:2:48.76 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:2:49.716 --> 0:2:57.116 
John Drum 
So I mean the fact that it says trace ID, I'm thinking it's something that's going to be used as part of the audit log, but. 

0:2:58.476 --> 0:3:15.396 
John Drum 
When I'm asking, it seems like you don't know yourself what it's for, especially since there seems to be a version attached to it. Is that the version of the API call? Is it the version of the trace ID? What does that refer to? 

0:3:16.996 --> 0:3:29.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I believe there is a X version ID which is being used in every API specifications. So that's that's that's what we continue here. 

0:3:17.916 --> 0:3:18.436 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:3:29.676 --> 0:3:42.116 
John Drum 
Is it part of customer 365? I mean, I'm not against using something that's supposed to be there, but I want to know what it is. I don't like things showing up without any idea what its purpose is. 

0:3:44.156 --> 0:3:51.956 
John Drum 
So let's research that to find out exactly what it is for. Otherwise, how do you implement it correctly? 

0:3:54.356 --> 0:3:57.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, then sure, we'll we'll research on that. 

0:3:58.676 --> 0:3:59.876 
John Drum 
OK, continue. 

0:4:1.356 --> 0:4:2.396 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And uh. 

0:4:3.876 --> 0:4:10.916 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
In the request body, I got rid of the template version because we decided on incrementing the version automatically. 

0:4:12.676 --> 0:4:16.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
If match templated exists already in the records. 

0:4:18.356 --> 0:4:21.716 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So those are the updates to the post end endpoint. 

0:4:25.916 --> 0:4:30.36 
John Drum 
On the create, right? That's the one that you were looking at on the, OK. 

0:4:28.36 --> 0:4:42.356 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, on the, yeah, yeah, on the create, yeah. And in the get endpoint it have added the line of business that it is active or not in department these three query parameters. 

0:4:38.516 --> 0:4:39.156 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:4:43.596 --> 0:4:49.36 
John Drum 
You have that in the crate also, right? So when you're creating it, you can tell the line of business. 

0:4:44.156 --> 0:4:46.276 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
But to give more control for the. 

0:4:50.636 --> 0:4:53.356 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, in the create also we have a input. 

0:4:50.956 --> 0:4:56.476 
John Drum 
This is just a you already have that, so this is just a filter for pulling it back, OK? 

0:4:56.756 --> 0:4:57.356 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Good. 

0:4:59.236 --> 0:4:59.316 
John Drum 
Um. 

0:5:4.516 --> 0:5:13.516 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We did not have any changes for this get endpoint. This is just to retrieve based on the template ID. We'll get all the versions for a particular template. 

0:5:17.796 --> 0:5:29.516 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And this is just to return the template configuration. I think one of the team members asked for this requirement. They just want the template config for a particular template inversion. 

0:5:29.516 --> 0:5:42.276 
John Drum 
So we also talked about adding that field for the template type, like if it was a letter, e-mail, push, SMS, are those added into these filters? 

0:5:45.276 --> 0:5:50.196 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
No, those are not added into the filters, but I had. Did you update the table for that? 

0:5:48.276 --> 0:5:49.396 
John Drum 
So let me. 

0:5:50.876 --> 0:5:59.876 
John Drum 
Yes, the table has to be updated for it, but also you need to have a filter condition so when you get it, you don't get a mixture of different types of templates. 

0:6:2.716 --> 0:6:10.156 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, so here we need an additional query param for the mode of delivery. Basically like letter e-mail or. 

0:6:9.116 --> 0:6:12.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
What? What is that for, John? What is that for? 

0:6:12.396 --> 0:6:28.556 
John Drum 
I don't know what you called it, but we talked yesterday about adding another field for the the communication type. Like is it a letter? Is it a SMS? But that also means you got to build a filter so that when you go get a list of the templates, you don't want to get the. 

0:6:19.636 --> 0:6:22.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. Yes, yes, yeah. 

0:6:26.876 --> 0:6:27.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:6:28.636 --> 0:6:31.356 
John Drum 
E-mail templates mixed in with the letter templates. 

0:6:31.516 --> 0:6:31.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:6:33.356 --> 0:6:42.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think I I let me, I think, let me check. I think I've did it yesterday on it. I'm not sure. Add to this table. Let me check. 

0:6:48.196 --> 0:6:52.276 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, uh, I'll add that filter so. 

0:6:53.196 --> 0:6:53.556 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:6:59.796 --> 0:7:19.236 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I have changed this from put to patch and got rid of the legacy template details since we don't need to. I mean we should not allow anyone to update that through this end point. We're accepting only these like display name, template name, all the template related fields can be. 

0:7:19.716 --> 0:7:24.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Updated sharing scope configurations, channels, all these things. 

0:7:25.876 --> 0:7:29.276 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Not the legacy details and the template ID and portion. 

0:7:40.556 --> 0:7:44.36 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
That's the only change we add in this one. 

0:7:46.196 --> 0:7:48.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And delete we did not have any changes. 

0:7:50.636 --> 0:7:51.916 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Stayed as it is. 

0:7:58.556 --> 0:7:59.876 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Template vendors. 

0:8:1.476 --> 0:8:4.356 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
But create it also will not have any changes. 

0:8:4.196 --> 0:8:8.836 
John Drum 
Can you go back in there a second? That's the. Let me see the crate. 

0:8:7.516 --> 0:8:7.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Sure. 

0:8:16.596 --> 0:8:16.636 
John Drum 
Oh. 

0:8:31.156 --> 0:8:31.316 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:8:37.836 --> 0:8:52.196 
John Drum 
The reason I wanted to see it is because we're we're using the same structure for other communication types besides letters. I wanted to make sure that it had the information in there necessary to identify a vendor like Salesforce versus. 

0:8:53.36 --> 0:8:55.796 
John Drum 
A print vendor like Smartcom so. 

0:8:56.556 --> 0:8:56.676 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:8:57.436 --> 0:8:59.396 
John Drum 
That's fine. It looks like it should be okay. 

0:9:2.556 --> 0:9:4.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And we have the. 

0:9:5.956 --> 0:9:7.676 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Get in point uh. 

0:9:9.236 --> 0:9:13.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
With some vendor is active is primary filters. 

0:9:13.916 --> 0:9:15.556 
John Drum 
I'll go back again. 

0:9:16.116 --> 0:9:16.876 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:9:18.796 --> 0:9:21.396 
John Drum 
Stop that vendor. That's not a. 

0:9:24.116 --> 0:9:27.196 
John Drum 
It's not a enumeration or anything, right? 

0:9:26.996 --> 0:9:29.476 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
No, it's not in emulation, it's a sync type. 

0:9:31.436 --> 0:9:39.36 
John Drum 
OK, because it needs to because there could be other ones like Salesforce and stuff that could be the vendor. We don't want to restrict it to a certain. 

0:9:36.996 --> 0:9:39.396 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, and we Yeah. 

0:9:40.356 --> 0:9:54.316 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we decided to leave this as string and string type now and have these possible vendors in the application properties to validate against. So the application properties can be updated when there is a new vendor. 

0:9:40.476 --> 0:9:40.596 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:9:55.956 --> 0:10:0.316 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Just so that you know not any string can be passed as a vendor. 

0:10:1.636 --> 0:10:4.116 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
But not restricting it as an enumeration. 

0:10:5.156 --> 0:10:6.356 
John Drum 
Say that one more time. 

0:10:6.276 --> 0:10:18.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Like so, but even though if it is, it is a string type, it's not an enumeration. We cannot just take any string that is passed in the request folder, right? Like let's say somebody sent ABC. 

0:10:20.596 --> 0:10:21.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We want to allow that. 

0:10:20.876 --> 0:10:21.476 
John Drum 
Why not? 

0:10:23.356 --> 0:10:27.396 
John Drum 
Why not? What would be the reason for restricting it? 

0:10:25.476 --> 0:10:25.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:10:31.756 --> 0:10:34.396 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
no particular reason. We thought that, you know. 

0:10:35.836 --> 0:10:43.36 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
The idea to not have it as enumeration is because it's possible to have a new vendor in the future. 

0:10:43.636 --> 0:10:43.796 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:10:44.756 --> 0:10:45.196 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
But uh. 

0:10:47.36 --> 0:10:49.836 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Getting any string value in there. 

0:10:51.956 --> 0:10:56.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
When we we wanted to add some kind of validation that can be configurable. 

0:10:58.236 --> 0:11:0.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Instead of restricting at a code level. 

0:11:1.356 --> 0:11:18.516 
John Drum 
The only way I would do that is if it's those items are in a config file and because I don't want to have to make code changes to add it. If you want to make just a config file entry to where you can just go into a document and add a new one, then that's fine, but I don't want any code that restricts it. 

0:11:19.436 --> 0:11:21.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, that that's what we thought of. 

0:11:23.196 --> 0:11:33.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So whenever there is a change in the vendor list, we'll just update the configuration and without touching the code, the validation should work as expected. 

0:11:34.396 --> 0:11:51.396 
John Drum 
So that that needs to go against more than just a vendor, because there's a vendor list per communication type. Like for letters you might have smart comma sent as handlebars or emails you might have Salesforce. 

0:11:41.836 --> 0:11:42.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:11:51.916 --> 0:12:9.116 
John Drum 
Or some other vendor, but you'll never have Salesforce for a letter. You know what I'm saying. So if you're going to put a check, that vendor needs to be also categorized by the communication type. 

0:12:0.516 --> 0:12:0.636 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:12:9.876 --> 0:12:14.316 
John Drum 
Which is like letter, e-mail, SMS, push, that type thing. 

0:12:17.396 --> 0:12:18.876 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, got it. Yeah. 

0:12:21.516 --> 0:12:23.276 
John Drum 
OK, continue. 

0:12:24.156 --> 0:12:24.676 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, so. 

0:12:26.596 --> 0:12:37.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
For this at end point and I have added this another get end point which takes master template ID and returns all the vendor mappings for that particular template. 

0:12:38.916 --> 0:12:40.36 
John Drum 
OK. Yeah. 

0:12:42.876 --> 0:12:45.196 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
The standard structure uh. 

0:12:47.756 --> 0:12:48.596 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:12:51.836 --> 0:13:0.316 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
This one we did not have any changes. It's to retrieve template vendor mapping based on the unique identifier in that table template vendor ID. 

0:13:1.36 --> 0:13:3.836 
John Drum 
No one returns all the templates to have that vendor. 

0:13:5.36 --> 0:13:14.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
No, no no. This is just like master template ID. Template vendor mapping also has a unique ID. This is to retrieve based on that ID. This is just written one entry. 

0:13:12.356 --> 0:13:14.116 
John Drum 
OK, oh. 

0:13:15.516 --> 0:13:23.836 
John Drum 
One of the things we had talked about was to be able to return all the templates based on a particular vendor, which which item does that? 

0:13:22.356 --> 0:13:30.916 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, that that this get endpoint has that rendered as a query parameter, so we can use this one to retrieve. 

0:13:31.476 --> 0:13:31.596 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:13:33.196 --> 0:13:36.156 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
all the template mappings for that particular vendor. 

0:13:38.196 --> 0:13:40.196 
John Drum 
OK. And that that's a string that'll work, OK. 

0:13:47.196 --> 0:13:51.516 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I have changed this from put to patch. 

0:13:50.476 --> 0:13:52.596 
John Drum 
OK, update. 

0:13:53.516 --> 0:14:2.996 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I got rid of a couple of fields that like master template ID and template version should be updated. So I got rid of those only the fields that can be updated. 

0:14:5.276 --> 0:14:6.796 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
This request body now. 

0:14:9.996 --> 0:14:16.876 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We can change the status or you know, make it active, primary, all those things through this endpoint. 

0:14:19.596 --> 0:14:19.876 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:14:25.516 --> 0:14:29.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
and we have the delete based on the template one of ID and 

0:14:31.156 --> 0:14:38.636 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
If you have any changes, it just takes the ID and deletes soft deletes that particular entry. We'll update both the status and. 

0:14:40.316 --> 0:14:40.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Archive flag. 

0:14:43.636 --> 0:14:44.36 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:14:45.636 --> 0:14:53.596 
John Drum 
Don't forget, since we're doing soft deletes, if you delete a template, they need to make sure you also soft delete all the vendors assigned to that template. 

0:14:55.876 --> 0:14:56.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. Yeah. 

0:14:57.916 --> 0:15:0.676 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we'll we'll take a note of that. 

0:15:9.676 --> 0:15:13.436 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, that's all the updates I've done to the template API spec. 

0:15:14.836 --> 0:15:16.756 
John Drum 
Do you have a copy function? 

0:15:21.436 --> 0:15:22.436 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
The copy of. 

0:15:21.436 --> 0:15:34.996 
John Drum 
Let's say that we want to, yeah, let's say that we want to create a new vendor, but we only need to modify a few values. Can I copy an old one to use as a starting point to modify to create a new one? 

0:15:37.756 --> 0:15:39.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
No, we don't have that effort. 

0:15:41.956 --> 0:15:43.956 
John Drum 
We should create something like that. 

0:15:47.636 --> 0:15:47.756 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:15:49.236 --> 0:15:49.476 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So. 

0:15:51.956 --> 0:15:58.76 
John Drum 
Let me think about that a second. This is on the API level. Do we wanna do it there? Do we wanna do it in the? 

0:15:59.36 --> 0:16:14.196 
John Drum 
I take that back cause you could they can just retrieve the one they want to copy from that'll that should preload whatever editor that's going to be in and then you can use that to save it and that'll give them a simulated effect because I don't want. 

0:16:6.956 --> 0:16:7.956 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:16:14.476 --> 0:16:29.716 
John Drum 
To actually create the record, which the copy API would do until they've actually finalized what they're going to create. Otherwise we'll have a bunch of just junk entries out there that don't never gets. 

0:16:31.156 --> 0:16:31.916 
John Drum 
Finalized. 

0:16:34.556 --> 0:16:37.76 
John Drum 
OK, I talked myself out of that. 

0:16:39.76 --> 0:16:39.196 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:16:44.596 --> 0:16:45.836 
John Drum 
What else we got? 

0:16:45.76 --> 0:16:45.236 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mm. 

0:16:47.276 --> 0:16:50.556 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
That's all I have. Uh, Tahir. Do you want to continue? 

0:16:55.236 --> 0:17:10.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm yeah, I can share it, but OK. Yesterday we were OK domain, we got the feedback like you want to have a sequence diagram for this flow, right? So I did that and. 

0:17:11.436 --> 0:17:12.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, habits. 

0:17:11.596 --> 0:17:18.756 
John Drum 
Well, a flow diagram or sequence or something. Those don't have to be now, but I mean, we're going to need that as part of the documentation. 

0:17:14.236 --> 0:17:14.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yeah. 

0:17:18.836 --> 0:17:21.36 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, I did that and. 

0:17:22.796 --> 0:17:28.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is the flow diagram. OK, so lapping at each other. 

0:17:27.916 --> 0:17:28.676 
John Drum 
Looks like teams. 

0:17:29.556 --> 0:17:35.636 
Pankaj Singh 
Where you keep kept it that is that the same that you're using it for document app? 

0:17:29.956 --> 0:17:31.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, that ****. 

0:17:32.636 --> 0:17:36.356 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
In the Lucid Lucid. 

0:17:36.836 --> 0:17:38.36 
Pankaj Singh 
Same listed, right? OK. 

0:17:37.956 --> 0:17:38.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes. 

0:17:41.76 --> 0:17:41.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:17:45.476 --> 0:17:51.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is the inquiry flow which we you you see this or is it very small John? 

0:17:51.916 --> 0:17:52.836 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:17:52.516 --> 0:17:55.236 
Pankaj Singh 
You can uh minimize the left hand side one. 

0:17:55.876 --> 0:17:56.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:17:57.876 --> 0:18:3.156 
Pankaj Singh 
Yeah. And now increase that to 70% or something. Yeah, should be fine now. 

0:18:3.636 --> 0:18:4.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:18:5.196 --> 0:18:11.116 
John Drum 
OK, and this is a a post. So this is the create the template. 

0:18:9.796 --> 0:18:14.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, no, this is the this is the document inquiry to fetch check ones. 

0:18:15.236 --> 0:18:17.636 
John Drum 
To fetch all the documents, OK. 

0:18:16.876 --> 0:18:17.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes. 

0:18:22.316 --> 0:18:26.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Which all of them? All of them. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. 

0:18:22.396 --> 0:18:25.436 
John Drum 
Not just the shared ones, but all of them for a given person. 

0:18:26.836 --> 0:18:26.956 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:18:28.956 --> 0:18:34.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So when we get the inquiry, we'll get we'll find the list of templates. 

0:18:33.316 --> 0:18:38.956 
John Drum 
What's the validate request? Start from the beginning here. What's the validate request for? 

0:18:35.876 --> 0:18:35.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh. 

0:18:39.436 --> 0:18:54.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It is validating what's what we are putting in in port like we are checking for account ID, it's present or not. Those kind of stuff. Yes, yes, yes. Then that goes to service inquiry document, a query service where? 

0:18:46.796 --> 0:18:49.956 
John Drum 
So you just check in for required parameters, OK. 

0:18:51.156 --> 0:18:51.356 
John Drum 
Next. 

0:18:55.76 --> 0:19:2.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Queries the database to find the templates, active templates and we get back the. 

0:19:1.676 --> 0:19:3.836 
John Drum 
For a given person. 

0:19:4.76 --> 0:19:5.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Not a given person. 

0:19:4.836 --> 0:19:17.796 
John Drum 
Which because there's two separate, there's two separate things that you're doing, right? One for the one-to-one documents and then the ones for the shared documents. So which are we doing first? Are this for the one-to-one assigned documents? 

0:19:11.676 --> 0:19:13.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes. 

0:19:17.396 --> 0:19:23.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This this this is for all documents like if you if you pass in the desktop documents which we need, yeah. 

0:19:22.556 --> 0:19:27.236 
John Drum 
I know the whole thing is, but I'm talking about this particular step, Step 4. 

0:19:29.516 --> 0:19:30.516 
John Drum 
Says find active templates. 

0:19:33.156 --> 0:19:34.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
The pitch. 

0:19:33.436 --> 0:19:38.36 
John Drum 
You're not looking for every active template in the bloody database, right? 

0:19:38.876 --> 0:19:40.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, let me check. 

0:19:39.196 --> 0:19:42.116 
John Drum 
You're looking for the ones that this person necessarily has. 

0:19:45.76 --> 0:19:45.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Repository. 

0:19:50.956 --> 0:19:52.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I like to templates start date. 

0:19:55.996 --> 0:20:0.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
The active flag is true and yeah, it's doing all actually. 

0:20:1.116 --> 0:20:10.956 
John Drum 
So that that's a problem because we may have 1000 templates, but a given person is not going to have 1000 letters. 

0:20:1.716 --> 0:20:2.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:20:11.596 --> 0:20:13.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I don't know. 

0:20:14.676 --> 0:20:31.236 
John Drum 
So why would we query against all the active templates if we're only looking for the letters that this person has? Now the reason you would do that is for shared documents to find out which shared documents you need to see what matches, but not all active templates are shared. 

0:20:24.756 --> 0:20:25.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:20:32.116 --> 0:20:32.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:20:33.836 --> 0:20:39.996 
John Drum 
So that's why I said there are two separate operations, one to get the one to one assigned documents. 

0:20:35.236 --> 0:20:35.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
There. 

0:20:42.36 --> 0:20:42.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:20:42.36 --> 0:20:47.436 
John Drum 
And then two, to get the list of the shared documents and then see if this person has any of those. 

0:20:49.716 --> 0:20:50.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:20:51.556 --> 0:20:53.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, yeah, uh. 

0:20:55.316 --> 0:20:59.516 
John Drum 
They have to be two different operations. You can't do them both at the same time. 

0:20:59.516 --> 0:21:0.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, mm-hmm. 

0:21:0.436 --> 0:21:2.436 
John Drum 
And then you got to orchestrate between them. 

0:21:4.476 --> 0:21:5.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, OK. 

0:21:7.756 --> 0:21:8.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
She. 

0:21:9.196 --> 0:21:20.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I'll do that. Yeah, that's good point. Yeah. Don't need to do all get pitch all the right active. That's makes sense. Yeah. So yeah, so then. 

0:21:21.596 --> 0:21:24.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I will check the sharing. 

0:21:22.876 --> 0:21:39.516 
John Drum 
Because I I take it this is the inquiry to return the documents for a person for the message center or the document center in the website, right? This isn't for the draft editor to just list all the the templates that they could be creating because that one doesn't. The draft editor doesn't show shared documents, only the. 

0:21:29.676 --> 0:21:30.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:21:35.956 --> 0:21:36.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
M. 

0:21:40.556 --> 0:21:44.196 
John Drum 
the uh individually assigned ones right? 

0:21:46.196 --> 0:21:51.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Draft editor OK, this is for document inquiry that the one for the website. 

0:21:49.876 --> 0:21:50.436 
John Drum 
This. 

0:21:51.676 --> 0:22:6.356 
John Drum 
I understand. That's why I said this is just the inquiry for the the message center. So that one, yes, you have to separate the query for the documents that are assigned directly to that account from the ones that are shared documents. 

0:21:53.276 --> 0:21:53.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:21:55.116 --> 0:21:55.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:22:3.916 --> 0:22:4.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:22:6.716 --> 0:22:9.356 
John Drum 
Because you you go about finding them different ways. 

0:22:9.756 --> 0:22:10.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. 

0:22:10.956 --> 0:22:23.996 
John Drum 
So when you're looking for the ones that are assigned to a person, right, you don't need to look at the template at all. You can just hit the instance table for the the matches for that account ID. 

0:22:13.436 --> 0:22:14.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. 

0:22:17.276 --> 0:22:18.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:22:21.436 --> 0:22:25.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. 

0:22:27.36 --> 0:22:34.116 
John Drum 
Right. But for the shared documents, that one you have to go out and find a list. Well, I take it back. 

0:22:28.116 --> 0:22:28.356 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Hmm. 

0:22:36.636 --> 0:22:46.116 
John Drum 
You do have to join on the templates to make sure that that document that they have is actually assigned to the message center. 

0:22:48.316 --> 0:22:50.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm, yeah, we're gonna have a radio system. 

0:22:49.196 --> 0:23:4.436 
John Drum 
Because not every document that they have in the document hub is displayed in the message center. So you do have to filter on that also, but that's that's still not every document out there now for the. 

0:23:2.636 --> 0:23:3.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. 

0:23:4.716 --> 0:23:20.116 
John Drum 
The shared documents. That's just the opposite. You got to go out and find out what's all the shared documents, which shared documents are actually in the message center, and then find out if that person actually which shared document they have, right? And then pull that back. 

0:23:11.756 --> 0:23:12.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:23:18.276 --> 0:23:18.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Hmm. Yep. Yep. 

0:23:20.956 --> 0:23:25.356 
John Drum 
So they're two separate operations. You you find the documents differently. 

0:23:26.956 --> 0:23:36.356 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. Yeah, yeah, I think, Yep, that's the that's a good point. I'll Yep. 

0:23:37.516 --> 0:23:40.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So to continue like, yeah. 

0:23:38.636 --> 0:23:45.276 
John Drum 
So does this. OK, So what do? So you got fine account specific documents. 

0:23:45.836 --> 0:23:45.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:23:48.156 --> 0:23:53.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, this is account specific. Find account specific. 

0:23:52.596 --> 0:23:54.516 
John Drum 
And when you say temlate type. 

0:23:56.356 --> 0:23:57.356 
John Drum 
What does that mean? 

0:23:58.836 --> 0:24:4.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is the template type is our. 

0:24:8.956 --> 0:24:10.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We have a template type here. 

0:24:11.716 --> 0:24:11.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh. 

0:24:12.396 --> 0:24:13.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, this is. 

0:24:15.196 --> 0:24:17.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Type. Yeah, this is the. 

0:24:20.276 --> 0:24:23.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Month statement disclosure and electronic disclosure kind of things. 

0:24:28.36 --> 0:24:29.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is the. 

0:24:30.956 --> 0:24:33.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh yeah, this is the. 

0:24:31.156 --> 0:24:39.716 
John Drum 
OK, but why are you filtering on that? Because that means you have to make that call separately for every single type, right? 

0:24:42.796 --> 0:24:47.36 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Every single. So you mean to say the query? 

0:24:45.436 --> 0:24:51.956 
John Drum 
Because if you just call and ask for all the ones for that account ID, you're gonna get all the template types, right? 

0:24:48.116 --> 0:24:48.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:24:53.276 --> 0:24:58.36 
John Drum 
The things you should be filtered on is like line of business, the Um. 

0:24:53.316 --> 0:24:53.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:24:59.356 --> 0:25:5.956 
John Drum 
The communication type and account ID. That way you get all the the. 

0:25:3.796 --> 0:25:4.36 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And. 

0:25:7.556 --> 0:25:10.36 
John Drum 
And also the whether it's the Um. 

0:25:10.876 --> 0:25:28.636 
John Drum 
There's an another field in here for a message center document flag that has to be true. And then those other types, you know one should be like letter and then the account ID and line of business for credit card and that should bring back all of the documents just for that person. 

0:25:24.796 --> 0:25:25.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Are we? 

0:25:29.236 --> 0:25:29.396 
John Drum 
Right. 

0:25:31.276 --> 0:25:39.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So how do we know this? This we're not passing this flag John in the API spec, so as a center flag. 

0:25:36.636 --> 0:25:38.436 
John Drum 
You should be. 

0:25:40.596 --> 0:25:47.956 
John Drum 
Yeah, if you don't, if you don't pass that flag, how do you know that you're gonna get all the documents, not just the one for the message center? 

0:25:52.396 --> 0:25:52.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:25:53.596 --> 0:26:8.276 
John Drum 
Because you know what? I mean, you may want all the documents in some other scenario, but not for use on the web. You only want the ones that we've actually marked to be displayed there. And then if we want to display new correspondence in the future, we just go to the template and turn that flag on. 

0:25:59.876 --> 0:26:0.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:26:8.956 --> 0:26:14.316 
John Drum 
And then it automatically will get picked up to be displayed in the future by the category that it's in. 

0:26:14.36 --> 0:26:14.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:26:15.396 --> 0:26:21.796 
John Drum 
But if you don't pass that flag, how's the API gonna know that this is being called from the website versus some other system? 

0:26:26.236 --> 0:26:26.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:26:28.996 --> 0:26:31.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You are just looking specifications OK. 

0:26:32.916 --> 0:26:35.116 
John Drum 
Remember the scenarios that we're talking about? 

0:26:34.716 --> 0:26:35.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:26:36.436 --> 0:26:40.356 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So what does the regulatory flag signify, John? 

0:26:40.396 --> 0:26:51.796 
John Drum 
The regulatory one says OK, if we go to print this and they're in a do not contact contact state, you know that's turned on. Regulatory still has to get printed. 

0:26:43.996 --> 0:26:44.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:26:51.676 --> 0:26:52.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:26:53.756 --> 0:26:53.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:26:55.196 --> 0:27:0.516 
John Drum 
Where if regulatory is false and they have do not contact, then we don't actually print it. 

0:26:55.396 --> 0:26:55.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:27:2.716 --> 0:27:2.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:27:3.796 --> 0:27:8.316 
John Drum 
It's used by a different control mechanism. 

0:27:9.36 --> 0:27:9.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:27:18.396 --> 0:27:26.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, yeah, I think this this one is like communication flag. The communication type is required. It's check against message. 

0:27:25.756 --> 0:27:31.276 
John Drum 
Right, 'cause we have templates in there that also are like e-mail communication, so you gotta have that filter. 

0:27:32.676 --> 0:27:35.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, e-mail, OK. 

0:27:34.956 --> 0:27:52.356 
John Drum 
And and then for the one like your inquiry, that one you're only pulling that back for the web stuff. So that has to have you know that message center the doc flag for the ones that are true. Otherwise you're going to get every correspondence that that person has and that's for the document hub. 

0:27:53.116 --> 0:27:55.956 
John Drum 
So that has to be passed. 

0:27:56.796 --> 0:27:57.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:27:59.316 --> 0:28:0.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is central offline, OK. 

0:28:3.436 --> 0:28:5.36 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:28:6.516 --> 0:28:17.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Coming back to this sequence diagram again. So OK, so you are checking all three types. One is account specific, sharing, scoping all and there is. 

0:28:19.116 --> 0:28:37.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Account type kind of sharing scope where based on the line of business we'll be segregating that. Then also we have custom rules where we have few documents, too few templates that are configured differently for. 

0:28:37.796 --> 0:28:41.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, different purpose. So then. 

0:28:41.196 --> 0:28:45.756 
John Drum 
You're very vague on those things. I I don't understand what you're talking about. 

0:28:53.276 --> 0:28:54.436 
John Drum 
The enterprise. 

0:28:57.836 --> 0:28:58.356 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:28:58.396 --> 0:29:1.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And that those also are picked up and. 

0:29:0.476 --> 0:29:3.636 
John Drum 
So how is Sherry's scope different than line of business then? 

0:29:7.356 --> 0:29:8.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, she she. 

0:29:12.476 --> 0:29:12.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
3. 

0:29:13.716 --> 0:29:20.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, actually this is this tells it's it's it's across the the document is OK. 

0:29:22.156 --> 0:29:23.516 
John Drum 
It sounds like the same thing. 

0:29:24.956 --> 0:29:25.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is a sharing score. 

0:29:25.996 --> 0:29:42.756 
John Drum 
Except you've got like the word all versus enterprise, but basically the lines of business is enterprise, which is all the lines of businesses, right? Then you have individual line of business like credit card, digital banking, whatever else they come up with in the future. 

0:29:29.276 --> 0:29:29.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uhuh. 

0:29:35.436 --> 0:29:36.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:29:43.36 --> 0:29:47.836 
John Drum 
So you're sharing scope all is like enterprise. 

0:29:43.116 --> 0:29:43.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:29:49.436 --> 0:29:59.636 
John Drum 
And then you mentioned credit card or account type. So I'm I'm not sure what sharing scope versus line of business is how they're different. 

0:29:59.916 --> 0:30:4.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. OK. OK. I got your point. Like, OK, line of business. 

0:30:5.836 --> 0:30:20.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I get your point. Yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, the line of business should be like digital enterprise and credit card and I think also can we have all on that? 

0:30:15.996 --> 0:30:16.556 
John Drum 
Yep. 

0:30:19.196 --> 0:30:33.996 
John Drum 
Because sharing scope, I thought you meant is like I thought originally sharing scope was who could access the the file. Maybe I misunderstood. I I didn't think you were using it like for the line of business thing. 

0:30:29.276 --> 0:30:29.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:30:37.676 --> 0:30:43.236 
John Drum 
Because some things, some correspondence may only be shared with like DNF. 

0:30:38.436 --> 0:30:38.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm. 

0:30:45.796 --> 0:30:45.836 
John Drum 
Uh. 

0:30:46.276 --> 0:30:46.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:30:49.636 --> 0:30:53.956 
John Drum 
But maybe that's not what you were using it for. That's just what I thought when I saw it the first time. 

0:30:56.36 --> 0:31:10.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, OK, this is like if it is null then it means that it's specific to an account. I thought of putting all wins it it this type of template is accessible to all the types of line of businesses or any any type of accounts. 

0:31:12.516 --> 0:31:16.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then there will be an account specific like. 

0:31:17.596 --> 0:31:22.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
For specifically for a digital bank or it will be for. 

0:31:23.516 --> 0:31:25.396 
John Drum 
But again, that's line of business, right? 

0:31:23.836 --> 0:31:32.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Enterprise, yes. And then there will be custom rules, right? So there could be customized rules that could apply. 

0:31:33.676 --> 0:31:34.196 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:31:34.196 --> 0:31:37.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So I thought of that on that line, so. 

0:31:38.956 --> 0:31:42.436 
John Drum 
Well, I suppose if you you could use it just for customized rules. 

0:31:42.516 --> 0:31:43.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:31:43.916 --> 0:31:45.436 
John Drum 
Regardless of line of business. 

0:31:46.156 --> 0:31:46.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:31:47.36 --> 0:32:0.556 
John Drum 
But you need to define it better than that. What is, what is, what does a customized rule mean? So I'm not adverse to having it, but it needs to be defined what it is and it shouldn't be something that we already have like line of business. 

0:31:57.436 --> 0:31:57.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:32:2.716 --> 0:32:3.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:32:4.316 --> 0:32:17.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So for example, if you want to share documents across across the types of documents, types of accounts, what is enterprise? Oh OK, so enterprise means everything. 

0:32:13.156 --> 0:32:14.356 
John Drum 
And it's enterprise. 

0:32:19.36 --> 0:32:20.956 
John Drum 
Yeah, your whole enterprise. 

0:32:19.996 --> 0:32:31.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, OK, OK, OK. So OK, enterprise mean everything. So OK, we'll have three credit card and digital bank enterprise mean both. 

0:32:32.236 --> 0:32:32.396 
John Drum 
Yep. 

0:32:33.236 --> 0:32:38.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, so OK, OK, got it. OK, OK, OK, this case up. OK, OK. 

0:32:41.636 --> 0:32:45.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. OK, that's. Yeah, that clears something. Yep. 

0:32:47.36 --> 0:32:53.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. So OK, so for no, so I'll change that to line of business and. 

0:32:55.476 --> 0:32:58.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
If it is enterprise, we'll have some custom rules. 

0:33:0.196 --> 0:33:0.516 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:33:0.916 --> 0:33:6.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So that would much clearer. OK, OK, got it. Mm-hmm. 

0:33:6.316 --> 0:33:10.836 
John Drum 
OK, so then you got to find shared documents. At least you got these separated. That's good. 

0:33:11.836 --> 0:33:12.836 
John Drum 
Let's see. 

0:33:14.876 --> 0:33:19.396 
John Drum 
And then you have your customer rules for E shared document using rules. 

0:33:20.276 --> 0:33:20.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
M. 

0:33:22.716 --> 0:33:32.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, you'll get if there is an external API call and we'll make get after getting a response, we'll extract that variable and add add it to the context. 

0:33:30.396 --> 0:33:30.916 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:33:33.276 --> 0:33:34.356 
John Drum 
Happy. 

0:33:33.636 --> 0:33:34.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So. 

0:33:35.276 --> 0:33:35.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:33:41.356 --> 0:33:45.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then if there is an eligibility criteria, then we'll uh. 

0:33:47.356 --> 0:33:50.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Evaluate that and if it is true then it will be picked up. 

0:33:54.756 --> 0:33:54.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then. 

0:33:54.876 --> 0:33:59.156 
John Drum 
And that's that's actually a loop operation, right? For each one of the shared documents. 

0:33:57.276 --> 0:33:59.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yes, yes, Yep. 

0:34:5.236 --> 0:34:5.356 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:34:15.436 --> 0:34:17.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then we'll query the storage dot index table. 

0:34:20.116 --> 0:34:22.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And then you'll find those documents. 

0:34:30.276 --> 0:34:32.436 
John Drum 
What's the item 27 for? 

0:34:34.636 --> 0:34:38.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Or duplicating documents if if you find multiple documents. 

0:34:41.276 --> 0:34:44.796 
John Drum 
But what's aggregate? Aggregate typically means when you combine things together. 

0:34:43.596 --> 0:34:53.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It's like all yes, yes, yeah, we're we're aggregating all the account specific and the documents which we find by custom rules and stuff and. 

0:34:55.756 --> 0:34:58.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, build that list of documents, right? 

0:34:59.516 --> 0:35:12.156 
John Drum 
So this is to build the list of documents that you're returning. So you're you're basically compiling both the one to one and the shared document into a comprehensive list organized by category. 

0:35:2.316 --> 0:35:2.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:35:11.316 --> 0:35:11.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:35:13.196 --> 0:35:13.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:35:15.756 --> 0:35:17.836 
John Drum 
And then you're applying pagination. 

0:35:22.956 --> 0:35:28.236 
John Drum 
What's the Hatos links? I know they talked about that, but I don't remember what it is. 

0:35:25.116 --> 0:35:26.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I'll be happy. 

0:35:27.876 --> 0:35:31.356 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, we have a links here in the response. 

0:35:33.476 --> 0:35:34.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
For download. 

0:35:36.356 --> 0:35:38.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Delete and. 

0:35:40.236 --> 0:35:43.716 
John Drum 
But what is the link? What is the link referred to? 

0:35:40.316 --> 0:35:41.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
For next step. 

0:35:46.436 --> 0:35:57.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
These are the what do you call links to the download the documents that comes from the ECMS. 

0:36:0.916 --> 0:36:4.436 
John Drum 
Oh, so it's the retrieval link. 

0:36:2.476 --> 0:36:12.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, little link and also for next item in the pagination we have next link and previous link. 

0:36:13.436 --> 0:36:17.636 
John Drum 
So that's being, that's being returned as part of the inquiry. 

0:36:17.796 --> 0:36:18.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:36:21.316 --> 0:36:23.156 
John Drum 
And it has a time frame. 

0:36:24.396 --> 0:36:29.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, I think that's that 10 minutes. So you mean to say the the ECMS one, yes. 

0:36:29.756 --> 0:36:37.76 
John Drum 
Yeah, so you're retrieving the links, but you don't have a a lifetime object that I see with it. So how do they know how long that that link's good for? 

0:36:38.756 --> 0:36:39.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, OK. 

0:36:43.196 --> 0:36:57.956 
John Drum 
So not a adverse to having a link, but if you're going to give a link that expires, you need to let them know when it expires so that they can refresh the link. Otherwise they'll make they'll get an error when they try to call it if it's past the expiration time, right? 

0:36:51.156 --> 0:36:51.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:36:57.636 --> 0:36:58.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm, Yep. 

0:37:2.236 --> 0:37:5.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think so. 

0:37:8.436 --> 0:37:8.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:37:12.956 --> 0:37:14.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We should have that, yeah. 

0:37:22.436 --> 0:37:25.596 
John Drum 
And we we also have. 

0:37:22.676 --> 0:37:23.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. Yeah. 

0:37:30.996 --> 0:37:34.716 
John Drum 
The document ID for it and see that. 

0:37:35.156 --> 0:37:35.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Is. 

0:37:38.956 --> 0:37:46.196 
John Drum 
But that's for the. I mean, the document ID is per document, right? This says it's a document list or is that a? Is that an array? 

0:37:43.996 --> 0:37:44.436 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:37:46.396 --> 0:37:47.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:37:49.116 --> 0:37:50.596 
John Drum 
Yeah, which one? 

0:37:49.716 --> 0:37:50.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Is. 

0:37:51.36 --> 0:37:54.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is an array and each yeah, yeah. 

0:37:51.756 --> 0:37:55.276 
John Drum 
All right. OK, so you have multiple entries each in there with the. 

0:37:57.76 --> 0:37:59.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Talk on ID and it's all. 

0:37:57.716 --> 0:37:57.836 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:38:0.596 --> 0:38:2.916 
John Drum 
And those others are links for a given action. 

0:38:7.756 --> 0:38:12.356 
John Drum 
So if they call that link, they're going to try to delete that document. 

0:38:8.236 --> 0:38:9.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
There are two types of links. 

0:38:15.36 --> 0:38:19.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We have this here, but I don't think we should be. 

0:38:18.156 --> 0:38:21.556 
John Drum 
Yeah, there should be no delete function in the get inquiry. 

0:38:23.796 --> 0:38:26.236 
John Drum 
At least not when they're doing it for the web. 

0:38:26.676 --> 0:38:27.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:38:32.356 --> 0:38:32.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:38:32.876 --> 0:38:37.396 
John Drum 
Besides, I thought we had different fields on the template that. 

0:38:35.156 --> 0:38:35.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:38:38.556 --> 0:38:46.36 
John Drum 
Expose the actions that were available. Are we checking that as far as before we send these things back? 

0:38:47.476 --> 0:38:49.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
What type of actions on? 

0:38:50.676 --> 0:38:56.516 
John Drum 
So on our template we have metadata that says what actions are available for that document, right? 

0:39:4.436 --> 0:39:4.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh. 

0:39:4.516 --> 0:39:10.796 
John Drum 
Filtering these actions here based upon the template for that given document type. 

0:39:4.556 --> 0:39:4.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh. 

0:39:10.516 --> 0:39:10.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh. 

0:39:13.396 --> 0:39:21.476 
John Drum 
Because it looks like you're just giving all the actions every time, which doesn't match what we have in our metadata for the template. 

0:39:13.836 --> 0:39:15.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Not yet. 

0:39:17.36 --> 0:39:17.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:39:20.636 --> 0:39:20.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:39:23.716 --> 0:39:30.356 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, we have an access control. Yeah, that has viewed. OK, download. Yeah, yeah, or. 

0:39:29.236 --> 0:39:36.396 
John Drum 
Right, so you should only be providing these items here that match that metadata that we have. 

0:39:33.236 --> 0:39:33.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh huh. 

0:39:36.796 --> 0:39:36.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:39:45.996 --> 0:39:46.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, yeah. 

0:39:55.36 --> 0:39:55.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I. 

0:40:2.516 --> 0:40:5.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is the sequence diagram for. 

0:40:7.876 --> 0:40:12.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Extracting a price disclosure code example. 

0:40:14.596 --> 0:40:24.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is how we are extracting. This is an example sequence diagram to extract disclosure code from the custom rules, yes. 

0:40:15.316 --> 0:40:17.116 
John Drum 
It's it's what again? 

0:40:21.636 --> 0:40:23.636 
John Drum 
All for the uh like shared document. 

0:40:25.76 --> 0:40:25.436 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:40:27.996 --> 0:40:28.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
O. 

0:40:27.996 --> 0:40:32.516 
John Drum 
What do we got? Can you zoom in a little bit? Those are very small letters, OK? 

0:40:34.916 --> 0:40:37.556 
John Drum 
Extract fields. 

0:40:44.796 --> 0:40:44.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So. 

0:40:45.356 --> 0:40:55.916 
John Drum 
Which fields are you talking about? So the fields you need are based upon the the shared document type, right? 

0:40:52.996 --> 0:40:54.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Configuration. 

0:40:55.916 --> 0:40:56.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:40:57.156 --> 0:41:0.396 
John Drum 
Because that's part of the configuration you have in there. 

0:40:57.836 --> 0:41:2.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Let me let me show you. Yeah, let me show you previous. 

0:41:3.636 --> 0:41:6.436 
John Drum 
Yeah, I remember the other day you showed me there was. 

0:41:6.236 --> 0:41:6.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
M. 

0:41:7.436 --> 0:41:10.756 
John Drum 
Field in the template that had the. 

0:41:13.356 --> 0:41:13.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:41:13.916 --> 0:41:15.476 
John Drum 
The mapping for the fields. 

0:41:17.156 --> 0:41:17.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:41:22.956 --> 0:41:24.756 
John Drum 
For a given endpoint. 

0:41:32.756 --> 0:41:33.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:41:38.596 --> 0:41:39.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:41:41.636 --> 0:41:42.76 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
See. 

0:41:44.996 --> 0:41:47.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, so here like we have fields to extract. 

0:41:49.556 --> 0:41:52.316 
John Drum 
Right. So go back to your other diagram again. 

0:41:49.756 --> 0:41:50.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I single yeah. 

0:41:54.356 --> 0:41:54.476 
John Drum 
So. 

0:41:56.916 --> 0:42:1.756 
John Drum 
You have a different is this call for all shared documents or is it their given type? 

0:42:3.796 --> 0:42:7.756 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is for all shared documents like fields to extract. Yeah, we'll yeah. 

0:42:5.396 --> 0:42:15.356 
John Drum 
OK, so first thing you have to know is which your document you're working with, right? Then you're finding which fields go to that shared document. 

0:42:10.676 --> 0:42:10.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:42:15.796 --> 0:42:16.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:42:16.756 --> 0:42:19.596 
John Drum 
Then build dependency graph. What is that? 

0:42:25.756 --> 0:42:30.796 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So we are extracting where exactly we are pulling that information, right? So. 

0:42:29.796 --> 0:42:40.516 
John Drum 
So this is the are you OK? Does that mean you're you're defining new endpoints to go pull that or is it information you already have? 

0:42:37.716 --> 0:42:46.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, so so so so pricing ID requests. So basically pricing ID requires account ID and disclosure requires pricing ID. 

0:42:47.716 --> 0:42:48.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That's the dependency. 

0:42:53.36 --> 0:42:53.156 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:42:55.156 --> 0:42:58.396 
John Drum 
What's doing that function? Which part? 

0:42:58.356 --> 0:43:2.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is configured data, extract service, yeah. 

0:43:1.116 --> 0:43:2.476 
John Drum 
Extraction service. 

0:43:5.796 --> 0:43:13.236 
John Drum 
An account arrangement API to get pricing ID pricing API to get disclosure code. 

0:43:14.916 --> 0:43:18.956 
John Drum 
And that's happening all inside of the this microservice. 

0:43:19.316 --> 0:43:20.36 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:43:23.36 --> 0:43:25.636 
John Drum 
You have a different microservice per uh. 

0:43:25.716 --> 0:43:30.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, no, it's all same X followed them, yeah. 

0:43:27.756 --> 0:43:33.476 
John Drum 
It's the same microservice for all of them. OK, so how do you know which one you're working on? 

0:43:37.956 --> 0:43:40.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is configurable, right? So just need to. 

0:43:39.476 --> 0:43:43.196 
John Drum 
I I know, but let me give you the scenario. You have three shared documents. 

0:43:42.36 --> 0:43:42.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:43:43.836 --> 0:43:43.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:43:46.196 --> 0:44:1.236 
John Drum 
Are you? You're not trying to return all three at the same time, right? They have all different criteria. So I'm taking it. You're looping through the three different ones. So where are you passing which shared document you're working on in this process? 

0:43:51.116 --> 0:43:51.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:43:53.956 --> 0:43:54.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:44:2.676 --> 0:44:8.116 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, it's coming from the aquari service, so each will look through. 

0:44:6.596 --> 0:44:16.76 
John Drum 
But you don't have a parameter there for the document. You got an account ID, a customer ID and a correlation ID. I don't see anything about the document type. 

0:44:17.476 --> 0:44:20.236 
John Drum 
So how do you even know that you're working on disclosure? 

0:44:28.36 --> 0:44:34.876 
John Drum 
You said this is handling all the different types, so that means when you call it, you're gonna have to tell it which type you're working with, right? 

0:44:30.956 --> 0:44:31.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:44:36.36 --> 0:44:36.876 
John Drum 
Unless I'm missing something. 

0:44:38.396 --> 0:44:44.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It's it's it's the code itself, right? So it's it's the it's a function that does this whole thing the method. 

0:44:45.316 --> 0:44:48.956 
John Drum 
So you're saying you got one function that's called that's? 

0:44:47.636 --> 0:45:1.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
There there are multiple function function that does different steps, but we just it has its own called responsibility. So let me go through the code actually. 

0:45:0.716 --> 0:45:6.316 
John Drum 
But you don't, you don't show a loop operation going on here. So what I'm seeing is that. 

0:45:4.116 --> 0:45:4.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:45:5.876 --> 0:45:16.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, OK. So every OK, I think in a query service for each template type will go through the loop. OK, you want to see the loop, OK. 

0:45:17.396 --> 0:45:32.476 
John Drum 
Well, yeah, otherwise, how do I know if you're if you're doing everything correctly? Because if you have to do a loop because you have multiples, and then when you're in that loop, you have to know which document type you're working with, right? 

0:45:21.276 --> 0:45:21.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:45:23.516 --> 0:45:23.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:45:27.156 --> 0:45:27.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes. 

0:45:32.516 --> 0:45:32.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:45:33.236 --> 0:45:38.796 
John Drum 
Because the the fields for disclosure may be different than for privacy notice. 

0:45:39.916 --> 0:45:40.156 
John Drum 
Um. 

0:45:44.396 --> 0:45:44.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:45:46.196 --> 0:45:50.156 
John Drum 
Because this this diagram is just sort of a vague flow. 

0:45:46.276 --> 0:45:47.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Let it be here. 

0:45:51.756 --> 0:45:55.556 
John Drum 
But it's nothing that you could actually give a developer to say, OK, develop this. 

0:45:55.236 --> 0:45:55.956 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:46:6.476 --> 0:46:7.956 
John Drum 
So you have. 

0:46:9.316 --> 0:46:10.476 
John Drum 
Step one extract pricing ID. 

0:46:11.516 --> 0:46:11.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:46:13.796 --> 0:46:20.156 
John Drum 
What if you're that given document doesn't use pricing ID? Are these steps different? 

0:46:18.596 --> 0:46:25.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, it it will have different different stuff different. Yeah, this is only for example for getting the disclosure code. 

0:46:28.476 --> 0:46:31.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Specific for that one, how we are accepting this information. 

0:46:31.996 --> 0:46:32.116 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:46:35.316 --> 0:46:37.196 
John Drum 
With resolve Uri. 

0:46:38.596 --> 0:46:38.996 
John Drum 
URL. 

0:46:38.716 --> 0:46:49.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So we'll, yeah, we have the in the configuration, we'll have the end point. Yeah, yes. 

0:46:47.436 --> 0:46:50.676 
John Drum 
Oh, that's the end point, right? OK, gotcha. OK. 

0:46:55.236 --> 0:46:56.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We'll call that endpoint. 

0:46:56.516 --> 0:47:10.436 
John Drum 
So this is going to making the call to return the pricing strategy based for the whatever it's looking for here pricing and it says disclosure code. The account arrangement API was for the pricing ID. 

0:46:59.796 --> 0:47:0.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:47:13.236 --> 0:47:17.996 
John Drum 
And does the pricing API use the pricing ID as part of the retrieval for the disclosure code? 

0:47:18.516 --> 0:47:18.836 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:47:20.396 --> 0:47:20.796 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:47:28.836 --> 0:47:33.636 
John Drum 
If I remember correctly, that PRC was part of the domain was used for the call. 

0:47:35.636 --> 0:47:39.996 
John Drum 
Say context put pricing. What's step 13 doing? 

0:47:41.76 --> 0:47:46.196 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Putting is putting that a variable into context, so for next step it will be required. 

0:47:48.36 --> 0:47:53.196 
John Drum 
Put it in the context. So you're making an API call passing this context. 

0:47:53.836 --> 0:48:5.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, it it is getting passed to the next step. Just the context. It's an object with global variable that would hold all the variables information. 

0:47:55.796 --> 0:47:56.476 
John Drum 
The contact. 

0:48:1.196 --> 0:48:1.316 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:48:6.156 --> 0:48:6.276 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:48:9.76 --> 0:48:10.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It's collecting all the information here. 

0:48:9.236 --> 0:48:13.356 
John Drum 
Extract disclosure code. All right, let's see. 

0:48:13.956 --> 0:48:21.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Similar steps like it's making extracting the URL and then populating the fields. 

0:48:22.836 --> 0:48:26.556 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And building the URL, making it API call. 

0:48:23.836 --> 0:48:24.396 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:48:28.116 --> 0:48:29.876 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
To the endpoint. 

0:48:32.516 --> 0:48:36.116 
John Drum 
What's it? What's the TNC code? 

0:48:32.836 --> 0:48:35.36 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Expecting, yeah. 

0:48:38.516 --> 0:48:42.316 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is the Cardel agreement TNC code. That's the disclosure code. 

0:48:42.996 --> 0:48:44.476 
John Drum 
Disclosure code OK. 

0:48:44.356 --> 0:48:44.636 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:48:50.676 --> 0:48:53.956 
John Drum 
And then you're putting that in the context and what do we got? Scroll down. 

0:48:56.716 --> 0:48:57.276 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So. 

0:48:56.796 --> 0:48:58.236 
John Drum 
Strike fields. 

0:49:1.596 --> 0:49:1.716 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:49:1.596 --> 0:49:2.476 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Doing better. 

0:49:6.116 --> 0:49:17.196 
John Drum 
I mean, it's a start, but it needs to be cleaned up and then show the entire looping operation because like like I said, if if you tried to give this to a developer, they wouldn't be able to do anything with it. 

0:49:22.516 --> 0:49:28.956 
John Drum 
So it's a good start. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to beat you up on it, but. 

0:49:25.396 --> 0:49:25.996 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:49:30.236 --> 0:49:33.36 
John Drum 
But we need to make it useful so. 

0:49:32.476 --> 0:49:32.596 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:49:35.556 --> 0:49:47.156 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. Yeah, let me work on it. Yep. But I'll I'll take the feedbacks. Yeah, I think there are quite a few today. So need to work on it. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll do that. 

0:49:38.956 --> 0:49:39.76 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:49:44.636 --> 0:49:44.876 
John Drum 
Mm. 

0:49:46.916 --> 0:49:50.196 
John Drum 
Yeah, I don't wanna give you too much feedback at one time if you lost it. 

0:49:48.996 --> 0:49:52.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yeah, that's all I think. 

0:49:53.996 --> 0:49:55.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, I'll do that to him. 

0:49:56.596 --> 0:49:58.356 
John Drum 
Alright, anything else? 

0:49:58.596 --> 0:50:1.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I think that's it. Anything else guys? 

0:50:6.356 --> 0:50:8.796 
Pankaj Singh 
Yeah, a lot of action to go for. 

0:50:10.156 --> 0:50:11.116 
Pankaj Singh 
A little. 

0:50:10.316 --> 0:50:11.516 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
When are you back, John? 

0:50:12.956 --> 0:50:15.196 
John Drum 
January 3rd. 

0:50:14.796 --> 0:50:16.76 
Pankaj Singh 
Next year. 

0:50:16.356 --> 0:50:17.716 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That we heard. 

0:50:17.876 --> 0:50:18.196 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:50:18.796 --> 0:50:18.916 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:50:19.236 --> 0:50:34.516 
Pankaj Singh 
I hope we have a clarity for Jagadeesh, Sundar, Satish and Modi right to at least continue the APIs that they need to work on correct after this or do we still need some guidance? 

0:50:34.436 --> 0:50:50.236 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I can't tell you that once you get the feedback, unless you take the feedback. So yeah, we'll we'll update those things again, then we'll show it to Jonathan. It's yeah, that. 

0:50:40.76 --> 0:50:43.516 
Pankaj Singh 
We got the feedback right now, right? So what feedback we are waiting for? 

0:50:48.356 --> 0:51:3.676 
Pankaj Singh 
OK, OK, fine. Let's let's have a final review tomorrow and then try to see what we can. My only thing is that this side, this guy should start working on the items. They should not be blocked. So OK, fine, let's see. 

0:50:51.396 --> 0:50:51.676 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:50:55.76 --> 0:50:55.396 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Sure. 

0:50:55.796 --> 0:50:56.396 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:51:2.236 --> 0:51:6.116 
John Drum 
Right. Focus on the things that they need to be able to continue work. 

0:51:6.236 --> 0:51:11.196 
Pankaj Singh 
Right. All right. Thank you all for joining. Bye. 

0:51:11.556 --> 0:51:12.996 
John Drum 
Alright, thanks.
