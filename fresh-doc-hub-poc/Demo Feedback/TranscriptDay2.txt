0:0:3.514 --> 0:0:10.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
The API specifications for template management. I think he'll go through that. 

0:0:21.234 --> 0:0:21.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No. 

0:0:28.594 --> 0:0:30.754 
Prachi Kulkarni 
I think Jatish was speaking on mute. 

0:0:30.754 --> 0:0:45.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK John, OK if if you mean meanwhile I can demo the what do you call this is what do you call rules engine what do you call where we can dynamically pick the shared documents. 

0:0:31.74 --> 0:0:31.754 
Satheesh Babu 
mute 

0:0:45.954 --> 0:0:47.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, shall we go through that first? 

0:0:54.354 --> 0:0:56.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
John, yeah. 

0:0:58.554 --> 0:1:0.514 
John Drum 
Sorry, I was muted. Yeah, go ahead. 

0:1:0.994 --> 0:1:8.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, sure. Yeah, let me share my screen. OK, this is the OK. 

0:1:11.514 --> 0:1:18.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Let me bring this here. OK, so John, let me go to the database. What are you called? 

0:1:22.34 --> 0:1:36.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So we have two types of shared document templates. One is to grab the cardholder agreement, another is another what you call. 

0:1:37.394 --> 0:1:45.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Rule based tired card agreement where let me go through the this record. 

0:1:48.754 --> 0:1:51.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Put up this actually so. 

0:1:50.714 --> 0:1:52.514 
John Drum 
Should also have privacy statements too. 

0:1:54.874 --> 0:2:1.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, actually I did two. OK, So what? What's the requirement for that, John? Like privacy statement? 

0:2:1.34 --> 0:2:4.674 
John Drum 
I don't know. You have to look in the legacy system, but it's another shared document. 

0:2:5.194 --> 0:2:14.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I I I did two two of these things to just to demo the work. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah, so one is the. 

0:2:9.994 --> 0:2:11.514 
John Drum 
For the demo, that's fine. 

0:2:16.74 --> 0:2:33.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
To get the pricing details and all the stuff to to get the cardholder agreement. So there is currently we are doing 2 steps, API calls. One is to get the pricing ID from this endpoint. I created a mock endpoint for that to get the information. 

0:2:23.554 --> 0:2:24.34 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:2:34.154 --> 0:2:39.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then using this uh pricing ID, we'll be calling the arrangements IP to get the. 

0:2:40.554 --> 0:2:42.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
What is this? 

0:2:45.594 --> 0:3:1.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, no, sorry, sorry. This is other way around. Step one is to get the to take the account ID from the payload and get the pricing ID. Using pricing ID we're getting the arrangement ID what is called. 

0:3:1.754 --> 0:3:5.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Cardholder agreement. That's a discretion. 

0:3:4.34 --> 0:3:7.394 
John Drum 
OK, and this code is stored where? 

0:3:9.154 --> 0:3:11.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, in the uh. 

0:3:12.74 --> 0:3:14.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
As a reference key as a disclosure group. 

0:3:15.114 --> 0:3:17.154 
John Drum 
No, no, no, that's not my question. So this is. 

0:3:19.714 --> 0:3:22.354 
John Drum 
A table in the master template. 

0:3:23.674 --> 0:3:26.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, Yep, this is a Yep, Yep, this is a yes, this is, this is. 

0:3:24.634 --> 0:3:40.434 
John Drum 
The definition field. OK, so this is data that's in there and then you use this and pass this to the because what I'm looking for is the flow. This this is being passed to the rules engine. 

0:3:30.74 --> 0:3:32.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, it's in the data. 

0:3:36.514 --> 0:3:36.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:3:40.394 --> 0:3:42.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes, Yep, it. 

0:3:40.954 --> 0:3:49.994 
John Drum 
Or something else. So you so you create the rules engine. It passes this. Does the rules engine query the database to pull back that data? How's that work? 

0:3:47.34 --> 0:3:47.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:3:51.194 --> 0:4:6.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We we Oh yeah we we are the the code already posts this information for the shared information shared what we call templates then it will passes to the rules code part where service where it will. 

0:4:6.74 --> 0:4:9.754 
John Drum 
So it passes those fields in when it calls the rules engine. 

0:4:6.314 --> 0:4:6.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
1. 

0:4:9.794 --> 0:4:12.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, Yep. And then. 

0:4:10.634 --> 0:4:13.634 
John Drum 
OK, that's the kind of information I'm looking for. 

0:4:13.994 --> 0:4:28.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep so it will yeah and it it it takes looks at the steps what we need it needs to perform. If if it is an external source we need to pull pull that information from then it will make that API call and pulls it through the looking at this particular. 

0:4:15.834 --> 0:4:15.954 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:4:29.594 --> 0:4:32.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Where exactly it needs to pull this? This is a Jason. 

0:4:32.394 --> 0:4:35.554 
John Drum 
Where's the code that passes this these parameters? 

0:4:35.794 --> 0:4:35.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:4:36.794 --> 0:4:39.394 
John Drum 
How does it know what those those values are? 

0:4:40.594 --> 0:4:41.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Let me uh. 

0:4:44.434 --> 0:4:48.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, this is the yeah, this is the config. OK, so. 

0:4:50.434 --> 0:4:51.874 
John Drum 
What am I looking at? 

0:4:51.354 --> 0:4:54.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is the code where it's it's doing the steps like uh. 

0:4:54.954 --> 0:4:59.914 
John Drum 
I understand that. What is this code called? What's it located? What is it? 

0:4:59.354 --> 0:5:2.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
In the service in the service um configurable. 

0:5:1.554 --> 0:5:4.994 
John Drum 
So you created a a microservice. 

0:5:5.554 --> 0:5:5.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:5:7.594 --> 0:5:9.714 
John Drum 
OK, and what does this service do? 

0:5:9.674 --> 0:5:16.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It it's basically sitting under the what you call document hub application itself. 

0:5:17.714 --> 0:5:18.354 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:5:18.514 --> 0:5:32.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So it's when we get when we query the the data inquiry document inquiry endpoint, it it pulls the shared documents we need to pull and check each one of these. 

0:5:34.34 --> 0:5:39.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Templates if that customer is qualified or not and then it matches the. 

0:5:39.754 --> 0:5:48.754 
John Drum 
So that's configured inside of the this configuration service. So when we add a new shared document, we'll have to come in here and add that into this. 

0:5:43.114 --> 0:5:43.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:5:48.794 --> 0:6:6.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Into the this table? No, no, it needs to add. We just need to add this in this data extraction config so it will do all the stuff like it goes to the external data service. If there is a new service we need to pull the information from, we just need to configure this in this configuration. That's it. 

0:6:3.34 --> 0:6:3.594 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:6:6.714 --> 0:6:13.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And it will take care of all these steps and pull that information and it will bring that data. 

0:6:12.714 --> 0:6:19.634 
John Drum 
OK, sometime I need to see a flow diagram or see and a sequence diagram of how that's all working. 

0:6:16.594 --> 0:6:16.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:6:20.194 --> 0:6:20.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:6:20.834 --> 0:6:27.754 
John Drum 
because that in the future that's going to be uh something that's not clear to people, so 

0:6:26.474 --> 0:6:34.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. I know I'm I I'm just wanted to remove the working model so far. I'm I'm working on it, so yeah. 

0:6:33.354 --> 0:6:37.34 
John Drum 
No problem. Like I said, I just saying those are future steps when you get in. 

0:6:36.874 --> 0:6:37.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:6:37.834 --> 0:6:47.794 
John Drum 
I'm trying to understand as we go through. So OK, so you have this, it's pulling the parameters and everything. You're calling a rules engine, passing those parameters, then what? 

0:6:43.714 --> 0:6:44.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:6:46.914 --> 0:6:47.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:6:49.394 --> 0:6:57.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then it will query the based on the selection of the templates, what you call template ID and the version. It will query the storage index table. 

0:6:58.954 --> 0:7:15.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
To pull that information from there. So we have like 9 records in the storage index table with this templates. Both templates are shared documents. 

0:7:15.874 --> 0:7:18.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And each one has different type of. 

0:7:19.674 --> 0:7:37.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Code called reference ID like like this one is for disclosure codes and this this is create tires like platinum, gold and standard. So that that comes based on the customer's what do you call? 

0:7:31.874 --> 0:7:32.354 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:7:37.554 --> 0:7:52.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Create history credit limit. So if if the customer is above some some threshold we we pull the platinum document for that if it is between any in mid level so we'll go for gold. 

0:7:53.194 --> 0:8:8.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That kind of decision we it will performs and that's all configured in in this data extraction logic. Let me go through that. So so it pulls the credit info basically. 

0:8:9.34 --> 0:8:14.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And based on that, oh sure. 

0:8:11.154 --> 0:8:14.914 
John Drum 
Can you make that window a little bit bigger? It's a it's a little small. 

0:8:19.34 --> 0:8:31.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is a, this is a sort of conditional matching. So credit limit is greater than or equal to 50,000. It picks the reference key as platinum. 

0:8:32.554 --> 0:8:33.74 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:8:33.274 --> 0:8:52.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And if so on so like for gold it checks greater or equal to 25 and it's below 25,000 goes for standard tire how do you call reference key. So and based on that it will build the query to query the data data storage. 

0:8:52.954 --> 0:8:54.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Table and it fix it though. 

0:8:58.474 --> 0:9:3.714 
John Drum 
OK. Have you had a chance to baseline any kind of performance on this? 

0:9:4.554 --> 0:9:15.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I need to do it, but so far it's pretty fast because the data is very small. Yeah, so I can demo it, yeah. 

0:9:10.754 --> 0:9:10.994 
John Drum 
Sure. 

0:9:13.114 --> 0:9:17.594 
John Drum 
We're not looking in seconds or anything, right? When you're doing your testing, it's in the milliseconds. 

0:9:16.954 --> 0:9:18.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes, milliseconds, yeah. 

0:9:20.314 --> 0:9:36.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah. So for arrangements APIs there are two steps right? So to pull the disclosure codes. So for first step is to pull put in the what do you call account ID and we get the. 

0:9:20.434 --> 0:9:20.754 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:9:36.234 --> 0:9:53.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It checks the domain ID domain equals to pricing and it pulls the domain ID as a pricing code. Then this is the this is how the arrangement IP arrangement API from accounts. 

0:9:45.914 --> 0:9:48.354 
John Drum 
What is the domain ID? 

0:10:6.234 --> 0:10:8.514 
John Drum 
Where do we get that information from? 

0:10:8.554 --> 0:10:9.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, Accounts Accounts team. 

0:10:10.834 --> 0:10:15.114 
John Drum 
I mean, this is some static data that they have set up somewhere. 

0:10:14.874 --> 0:10:19.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, no. Actually, uh, there is a endpoint. Let me go through the. 

0:10:20.434 --> 0:10:27.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, let me recall. OK, let me. Yeah, I think, uh, they gave me an example here. Let me. 

0:10:28.834 --> 0:10:30.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
What is this? OK. 

0:10:31.954 --> 0:10:39.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is an existing flow that Ved gave me an example for for pulling the disclosure codes. 

0:10:40.594 --> 0:10:41.314 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:10:42.434 --> 0:10:56.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So so this is out of the actual endpoints like the credit card accounts slash account ID and arrangements and there's a get call. It gives us the information and using the pricing code we will be. 

0:10:52.394 --> 0:10:53.274 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:10:57.954 --> 0:10:59.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Pulling up the. 

0:11:0.834 --> 0:11:3.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Card roller agreement from that so. 

0:11:3.194 --> 0:11:7.234 
John Drum 
Is this legacy you're talking about or the modern platform? 

0:11:7.674 --> 0:11:14.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
How the.net is picking the agreements right now? 

0:11:13.994 --> 0:11:17.994 
John Drum 
OK. And does that still work when you're looking at the modern platform? 

0:11:19.114 --> 0:11:22.194 
John Drum 
Because we have to query from there, right? 

0:11:19.194 --> 0:11:22.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think so. Yep. Yeah. Yep. 

0:11:23.274 --> 0:11:23.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:11:25.194 --> 0:11:41.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This whole logic is built on that. Yeah, if if something changed, we need to change the extraction record. Just we need if if you change this thing, it should work perfectly. If there is a so we don't need to go and change the code for that. 

0:11:37.154 --> 0:11:37.474 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:11:43.354 --> 0:12:1.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So let me OK, so this is the first step. Then using this domain ID or the pricing ID we'll pull the particular respective Cartel agreement that gives us the Cartel agreement TNC code that's 164 and we are storing this information in. 

0:12:1.354 --> 0:12:15.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Our against the each document. So this is the reference keys like for the same template we have different types of disclosures. 

0:12:11.954 --> 0:12:12.274 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:12:16.954 --> 0:12:21.794 
John Drum 
But that doesn't show there. That reference key doesn't have a version, does it? 

0:12:23.994 --> 0:12:31.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, for reference key? No, I think this is for master. The version is against the master. 

0:12:29.674 --> 0:12:41.74 
John Drum 
OK, but so let's let's back up a second. I understand what you're doing there. OK, that's fine. The document itself. 

0:12:34.514 --> 0:12:34.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:12:37.74 --> 0:12:37.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:12:41.594 --> 0:12:42.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:12:42.834 --> 0:12:45.74 
John Drum 
the D one sixty-five. 

0:12:45.354 --> 0:12:45.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:12:46.834 --> 0:12:54.314 
John Drum 
in our instance table for the document hub. It's there. 

0:12:51.874 --> 0:12:52.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:12:54.74 --> 0:12:54.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:12:55.194 --> 0:13:0.674 
John Drum 
You have or can have multiple versions of them as they revise it, right? 

0:13:0.954 --> 0:13:10.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes, yeah, that's yeah, we have the this information in the what do you call it? We can put that information in the effective date like. 

0:13:11.674 --> 0:13:18.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
The validity of that thing. Basically we can have multiple, same thing with multiple. 

0:13:20.434 --> 0:13:34.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Validity printed like this. This particular disclosure should be valid for 2025. So so we we have that check like it will check for the effective date. 

0:13:28.474 --> 0:13:28.594 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:13:33.114 --> 0:13:35.354 
John Drum 
And what if it returns more than one document? 

0:13:37.754 --> 0:13:39.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
If it returns more than one document. 

0:13:40.714 --> 0:13:56.314 
John Drum 
Yeah. So let's say you have an effective date in there that that returns one document today. Somebody adds a new one that's in the future. So at that point, when you run that same query with the effective date, it's going to pull back the one it used to plus the new one. 

0:13:45.874 --> 0:13:46.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:13:56.634 --> 0:13:58.954 
John Drum 
What do you do when you get more than one returned? 

0:14:5.74 --> 0:14:8.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Effective date, so the affected it and. 

0:14:12.634 --> 0:14:20.554 
John Drum 
And you're also taking for granted that the new one that's added is the current one. It may not go into effect. 

0:14:14.194 --> 0:14:14.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I think. 

0:14:17.194 --> 0:14:17.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:14:23.714 --> 0:14:24.994 
John Drum 
For, let's say. 

0:14:27.514 --> 0:14:31.314 
John Drum 
Two months, but they added it to the document hub today. 

0:14:33.714 --> 0:14:52.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, I, I, I, I, I, I yeah, I think you get what you're saying like no for future date. Yeah. So we are checking for like the effective date when it is valid. So we are we have dates against the template as well as in against each instance. 

0:14:34.914 --> 0:14:35.434 
John Drum 
So while that's. 

0:14:52.874 --> 0:15:0.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
For effect effective date from where it is valid and till what date it is ending. So there. Mm-hmm. 

0:14:58.394 --> 0:14:59.914 
John Drum 
Let me give you a scenario. 

0:15:1.234 --> 0:15:9.154 
John Drum 
So we're we're we have an effective date that covers the latest version of let's say a privacy statements in production. 

0:15:8.474 --> 0:15:9.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, mm-hmm. 

0:15:10.474 --> 0:15:17.154 
John Drum 
They have another privacy statement that they've just got. They want it to go into production two months from now, so they add it to the document. 

0:15:15.714 --> 0:15:15.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:15:17.594 --> 0:15:18.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:15:18.394 --> 0:15:23.194 
John Drum 
That effective date is later than the effective date for the one that they're currently using. 

0:15:23.514 --> 0:15:23.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:15:24.554 --> 0:15:30.314 
John Drum 
But they don't want to use it yet because it's not there, but so when you pull back this one. 

0:15:32.74 --> 0:15:35.114 
John Drum 
You're going to get this one plus the future one too, right? 

0:15:35.34 --> 0:15:37.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, no, no, no, no, you shouldn't. 

0:15:36.514 --> 0:15:43.474 
John Drum 
Well, the effective date is before the other effective date, so it's going to return everything that's after it. 

0:15:45.514 --> 0:15:51.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, no, we're checking the date range like if it is the current, it falls under the first effective. 

0:15:50.154 --> 0:15:52.594 
John Drum 
I didn't see a date range. I only seen one date. 

0:15:52.914 --> 0:16:9.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, actually what I did it for on the other branch, but there are there were a huge modification to the data. I don't want to disturb the demo part, so I have just moving that. So yeah, I did like checked for like. 

0:16:9.754 --> 0:16:29.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Future dates like if the what you call disclosure needs to go for effective from January 1st, 2026, it won't come. If I pull that information today, it won't pull. So if we've pulled it for on January 1st, the the December one would. 

0:16:29.594 --> 0:16:44.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It was be skipped because the effective date validity expires on say December 31st, 2025 but it will pick the one, the new one from the January on January 1st. 

0:16:45.154 --> 0:16:53.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So I did that part, but I couldn't demo this today because I don't want it to. I've tested this whole things on Friday for. 

0:16:54.714 --> 0:17:4.794 
John Drum 
That's fine. I just want to make sure when we do our QA criteria testing, it it tests all those scenarios because those are the kind of things that bite us. 

0:16:58.474 --> 0:17:0.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

0:17:3.154 --> 0:17:4.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, I I I I get you. 

0:17:5.314 --> 0:17:21.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I I did. I I I'm going to demo this tomorrow. I think I just wanted to just take your record approval for the logic I'm trying to do because if I invest more time in this and I'm not going anywhere, then that's that would be a blocker. 

0:17:15.754 --> 0:17:16.474 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:17:22.34 --> 0:17:38.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So that's why I want to. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, I totally get that. Yep, that's totally. Yeah. So. So and let. OK, so this is how we. OK, so we have the. 

0:17:23.434 --> 0:17:28.34 
John Drum 
I'm not saying to stop, I'm just bringing up issues as I think of them. 

0:17:38.274 --> 0:17:38.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh. 

0:17:40.194 --> 0:17:45.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is the old one and like effective date is OK, let me see. 

0:17:43.914 --> 0:17:49.874 
John Drum 
I see you have a version number in your uh criteria too. 

0:17:46.314 --> 0:17:46.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:17:51.954 --> 0:17:52.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:17:52.74 --> 0:17:53.954 
John Drum 
Is that referring to the D165? 

0:17:56.154 --> 0:17:58.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
D165 Yeah, yeah. 

0:17:58.74 --> 0:18:14.794 
John Drum 
Now like if you go back to your document creation date extraction thing there at the very beginning it says version 1.0, the document type and then disclosure code. Does it use that version number as part of that disclosure code or is it referencing something else? 

0:18:8.514 --> 0:18:8.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:18:14.394 --> 0:18:28.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I need to check like been like on I did this on Thursday. I think I need to check if we are referencing this version or not, but I I believe it is checking for the effective date. 

0:18:30.314 --> 0:18:31.74 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:18:30.834 --> 0:18:35.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You're checking for it for two days. Yeah. So, OK, so. 

0:18:35.754 --> 0:18:37.954 
John Drum 
So I understand that part. Go ahead. 

0:18:37.114 --> 0:18:53.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And then yeah so if for D 164 so for for OK so if if you check for account ID 01 we have pricing code 1224 and. 

0:18:54.154 --> 0:18:55.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Disclosure code as 160. 

0:18:58.114 --> 0:19:1.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
164 So if I query this document inquiry. 

0:19:3.434 --> 0:19:10.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
For this particular account, it should give me this particular specific disclosure code. 

0:19:14.514 --> 0:19:24.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Value 164 and particular file name and and this this customer has. 

0:19:26.154 --> 0:19:27.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Record. 

0:19:29.474 --> 0:19:44.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Platinum tire. I just made this up like it's this is not specific URL what you call API in our system, but just tells us that if the credit info for this particular account is platinum it. 

0:19:44.714 --> 0:19:48.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It picks up the platinum level agreement. 

0:19:50.234 --> 0:19:52.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Or offer something kind of thing. 

0:19:53.834 --> 0:19:57.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So it picks up this Platinum credit card agreement. 

0:19:59.994 --> 0:20:5.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And Yep, this is one example. Then for 165 we have another so. 

0:20:5.314 --> 0:20:5.434 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:20:8.74 --> 0:20:13.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So it's not picking other disclosures for this particular account. 

0:20:15.914 --> 0:20:20.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And this is 166 example. 

0:20:21.954 --> 0:20:23.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is. 

0:20:26.114 --> 0:20:27.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Do you want 166? 

0:20:29.754 --> 0:20:38.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And it's this. This is a gold tire agreement for this particular user customer. 

0:20:38.994 --> 0:20:39.154 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:20:41.554 --> 0:20:42.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So. 

0:20:44.274 --> 0:20:46.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So, OK, so. 

0:20:48.714 --> 0:20:50.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, uh, I think. 

0:20:52.514 --> 0:20:54.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Does this look good, John? 

0:20:56.874 --> 0:21:9.354 
John Drum 
Yeah, the only thing I don't and maybe it's not important because you have an account ID, but wasn't there supposed to be line of business in here somewhere or you just take it for account that line of business would be different for the account ID? 

0:21:4.754 --> 0:21:5.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, yeah. 

0:21:9.634 --> 0:21:22.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, I this, this, this would come in picture, but this is just for POC for building the logic how it picks the shared document right so that I was concentrating on that one. So yeah. 

0:21:20.234 --> 0:21:25.794 
John Drum 
So it's. I didn't know if it was one of the parameters that you're passing to filter on. 

0:21:24.394 --> 0:21:39.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, it it it it this would get in picture once once I put that information. So as it just does POCS, so I didn't concentrate on that part. Should we we'll be, yeah, we'll be pulling this information, yes. 

0:21:33.74 --> 0:21:33.234 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:21:37.434 --> 0:21:37.754 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:21:40.954 --> 0:21:43.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Maybe against the line up in this. 

0:21:44.834 --> 0:21:44.954 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:21:48.234 --> 0:21:48.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And. 

0:21:50.354 --> 0:21:57.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, so I will also want to demo this another thing. Let me go to the git check on. 

0:22:11.794 --> 0:22:11.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:22:16.74 --> 0:22:31.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is the part which I have what you call created multiple scenarios like the validity period and how the effective date box. I I'll demo this tomorrow but I want to show you this one which I did yesterday. 

0:22:33.554 --> 0:22:35.314 
John Drum 
Who's in the demo tomorrow? 

0:22:35.594 --> 0:22:39.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I I I will reset setting up something tomorrow. 

0:22:42.154 --> 0:22:53.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I I didn't test it this completely, but that's why I'm not demoing it. OK, so I build a disk dot gifs. I can open this. 

0:23:1.114 --> 0:23:11.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So for populating this information like to build the templates John like how how we are going to. 

0:23:8.314 --> 0:23:8.834 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:23:12.514 --> 0:23:19.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, get this information like uh so I build a HTML page that does few things. 

0:23:20.554 --> 0:23:27.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And we need to put that information at template type document category what outline. 

0:23:26.514 --> 0:23:28.114 
John Drum 
What is the? What's the template type? 

0:23:28.874 --> 0:23:31.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Temperate type is the Uh. 

0:23:32.834 --> 0:23:39.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Different types of templates, right? So like you remember so we can add this type here. 

0:23:36.154 --> 0:23:38.154 
John Drum 
But what if I have a new template type? 

0:23:43.434 --> 0:23:54.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And it comes up in the OK in the drop down. But I mean I need to link this with the database. This is just a plain HTML. 

0:23:54.914 --> 0:23:55.434 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:23:56.394 --> 0:24:6.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So this is, yeah, we can add this type and if there is a document category, we can add that too. We have three line of businesses, credit card, digital and enterprise. 

0:24:7.914 --> 0:24:13.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And template versions we need to if if there are that. 

0:24:12.234 --> 0:24:15.994 
John Drum 
Where do you say whether it's shared or not? 

0:24:14.874 --> 0:24:26.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That's the next step. Like next step, actually that's the next step. So we have this flags active, accessible, regulatory, notification needed. 

0:24:19.154 --> 0:24:19.274 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:24:28.74 --> 0:24:37.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And next step, so is it account specific or a customer wide or say conditional or shared public? 

0:24:38.314 --> 0:24:52.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then next and if what feels it needs to put in the metadata instance so we can add few customized variables, we can add some permission. 

0:24:54.434 --> 0:24:57.594 
John Drum 
OK, this is just for the master template, right? 

0:24:57.754 --> 0:25:10.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, this is for master number, yes. So how what reference key type we need to put in here like account ID or a disclosure code or something like that. Or we could just add a new one altogether. 

0:25:17.74 --> 0:25:31.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So that can be used for future purpose. Then next we so this will build the like what you called where exactly we need to put this pull this information from so like. 

0:25:32.354 --> 0:25:33.74 
John Drum 
Good. 

0:25:32.794 --> 0:25:39.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We can upload a API specifications like. 

0:25:38.754 --> 0:25:39.674 
John Drum 
I like it. 

0:25:42.714 --> 0:25:45.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
What is this? 

0:25:47.234 --> 0:25:47.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh. 

0:25:54.674 --> 0:25:55.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Docs. 

0:25:57.234 --> 0:26:1.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, so this would, uh, give us the. 

0:26:3.194 --> 0:26:5.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, what are you called? 

0:26:6.754 --> 0:26:10.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Information like what are, what are these we can pull this from. 

0:26:12.354 --> 0:26:18.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You can just select this part and it will put this in the extraction config. 

0:26:20.114 --> 0:26:23.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And then and then next step is to. 

0:26:20.514 --> 0:26:20.834 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:26:25.34 --> 0:26:39.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I had access rules. I I didn't did anything for this one. Then review this thing. We can either download an SQL or we could end and and what do you call it? 

0:26:40.394 --> 0:26:47.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, we can integrate with an API and that would call that API and store that information. So yeah. 

0:26:49.74 --> 0:26:58.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This is this is work in progress, not complicated yet. So that's just a model. Yeah, so yeah. 

0:26:55.354 --> 0:26:56.394 
John Drum 
Understood. 

0:26:57.914 --> 0:27:0.434 
John Drum 
I mean what I see so far, it looks good. 

0:27:0.154 --> 0:27:6.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. So this would go and store gets stored in the master template definition table. 

0:27:7.274 --> 0:27:14.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And Yep, and this would be. I think we could just put in a download in SQL. 

0:27:16.514 --> 0:27:16.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
See. 

0:27:25.154 --> 0:27:38.354 
John Drum 
And do we have just questions? I know you've not had enough time to do all this stuff, but is it going to be the same editor to do the vendor specific template piece or is that going to be a different screen? 

0:27:40.874 --> 0:27:53.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
There there will be another tab here or we could or we could or we could. Once we put this information then we we get the template ID and version ID. Using that we could. 

0:27:44.114 --> 0:27:46.514 
John Drum 
Another tab for the vendor. 

0:27:51.954 --> 0:27:55.794 
John Drum 
'Cause yeah, it has to be linked to the master template, right? That you're right there. 

0:27:54.34 --> 0:28:3.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, yes, yes, Yep. That would require a Yep. Let me open with this. OK. 

0:28:8.594 --> 0:28:15.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, this is the this is the one which build. It was just built here. Let me see if it works. 

0:28:19.794 --> 0:28:20.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:28:21.714 --> 0:28:27.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, it's not building it correctly, so yeah, but let let's see if. 

0:28:31.354 --> 0:28:34.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It if it works or not. 

0:28:39.34 --> 0:28:41.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, there is some issue. It's not building the correct. 

0:28:43.394 --> 0:28:49.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
SQL. But yeah, this is concept POC. So yeah, still working on it. 

0:28:50.274 --> 0:28:53.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, just wanted to show you those things. Are we on the right track too? 

0:28:54.154 --> 0:29:5.754 
John Drum 
I think so. It looks good to me after it works, of course. But yes, it's the it's the exact idea of what I wanted the. 

0:28:56.394 --> 0:28:57.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:29:0.234 --> 0:29:0.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:29:9.434 --> 0:29:25.394 
John Drum 
Of course you'll need because this is creating a new one, right? You'll need to be able to modify existing ones and you know all those functions, add, modify, delete type of thing. Plus you'll want an audit trail for what happens in here. 

0:29:10.874 --> 0:29:11.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Hmm. 

0:29:13.314 --> 0:29:13.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:29:15.234 --> 0:29:15.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No. 

0:29:20.234 --> 0:29:21.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, Yep. 

0:29:25.834 --> 0:29:37.994 
John Drum 
And how are you limiting scope or what was your thought on who has access to this and where does this? Where are you accessing this from? 

0:29:38.554 --> 0:29:43.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, this is just a HTML page right now. I think we should be building, yeah. 

0:29:42.314 --> 0:29:47.34 
John Drum 
I understand. I'm just talking about what your thoughts are on how this was going to go. 

0:29:47.154 --> 0:29:57.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, I think this should be only accessible to few people like who can like admin people. 

0:29:56.74 --> 0:30:6.514 
John Drum 
Mhm. So you're going to integrate it in with SSO, you're going to integrate it in with just Active Directory. What? What were your thoughts? 

0:30:15.714 --> 0:30:16.34 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:30:16.114 --> 0:30:16.274 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:30:16.114 --> 0:30:21.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Build the Um role based access Uh settings so that. 

0:30:21.474 --> 0:30:27.754 
John Drum 
Because remember, this will have to be accessed by back office every time they create a new. 

0:30:25.794 --> 0:30:26.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:30:28.954 --> 0:30:30.634 
John Drum 
Document type, right? 

0:30:31.34 --> 0:30:32.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep, Yep, Yep. 

0:30:33.674 --> 0:30:41.634 
John Drum 
And then also remember this has to integrate into a process flow because they'll be approval processes for these things. 

0:30:42.34 --> 0:30:43.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm, mhm. 

0:30:43.314 --> 0:30:52.674 
John Drum 
So that's why I was asking what you're thinking about hosting, because it's actually, I believe it would be hosted by the workflow process, right? 

0:30:53.234 --> 0:30:53.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:30:53.634 --> 0:30:58.714 
John Drum 
This is the first step in the workflow and then after this is created. 

0:31:0.114 --> 0:31:7.714 
John Drum 
And the vendor piece of it is created, then this would have to go through a work will process to get approval before it's ever approved. 

0:31:2.754 --> 0:31:3.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:31:8.474 --> 0:31:8.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
She. 

0:31:10.594 --> 0:31:11.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. Yeah. 

0:31:10.594 --> 0:31:26.114 
John Drum 
I just wanted to see if you were thinking along those lines. If you're thinking, oh, this is going to be its own little website, so it's out there and just does this. It has more integration needs than just that, so. 

0:31:22.914 --> 0:31:28.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. This. Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh. 

0:31:26.954 --> 0:31:39.634 
John Drum 
Continue to work through what you're doing, but it is part of a bigger process. It has to be part of, you know, and The thing is, is all these things that you're doing can't go into effect yet. 

0:31:29.74 --> 0:31:29.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:31:32.874 --> 0:31:33.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:31:39.74 --> 0:31:40.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. 

0:31:41.714 --> 0:31:57.594 
John Drum 
But that's part of the there's a status on the template, right? Like pending and stuff. So we have to make sure that when we're using those templates, the APIs that use it, look at that status and don't pull back any pending ones that haven't been approved. 

0:31:45.314 --> 0:31:45.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:31:54.74 --> 0:31:54.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:31:59.874 --> 0:32:0.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:32:0.274 --> 0:32:4.474 
John Drum 
But I like this. This is it had a nice flow to it. Um. 

0:32:4.114 --> 0:32:4.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:32:7.754 --> 0:32:8.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:32:8.434 --> 0:32:10.514 
John Drum 
And I think it'll get us where we need to go. 

0:32:10.754 --> 0:32:11.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:32:13.234 --> 0:32:16.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, Jagdish, Are you ready for the template management piece? 

0:32:17.794 --> 0:32:18.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
S the header. 

0:32:21.674 --> 0:32:21.794 
John Drum 
So. 

0:32:21.874 --> 0:32:22.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Shall I share my screen? 

0:32:23.634 --> 0:32:28.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, but your voice is very low, man. Can you speak or? 

0:32:27.194 --> 0:32:29.754 
John Drum 
Yeah, I can't hear him at all. 

0:32:29.394 --> 0:32:32.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Can you hear me now? 

0:32:32.434 --> 0:32:33.954 
John Drum 
Very soft. 

0:32:32.994 --> 0:32:34.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It's better, but it's very soft. 

0:32:39.594 --> 0:32:40.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, just give me a second. 

0:32:49.554 --> 0:32:50.754 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, how about now? 

0:32:53.434 --> 0:32:56.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
It's same actually nothing. Nothing changed. 

0:32:55.554 --> 0:32:59.394 
John Drum 
Yeah, no difference. It's like you're at the end of a tunnel. 

0:33:0.594 --> 0:33:4.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me rejoin otherwise. 

0:33:32.594 --> 0:33:35.234 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Hi, is it any better or it's still the same? 

0:33:35.714 --> 0:33:40.274 
John Drum 
It's better, yeah. Bit of an echo effect, but it's it's better. 

0:33:35.914 --> 0:33:36.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Nice. 

0:34:23.874 --> 0:34:23.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:34:31.954 --> 0:34:32.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:34:38.34 --> 0:34:39.594 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Hi, can you guys hear me? 

0:34:39.874 --> 0:34:41.394 
John Drum 
Much better. 

0:34:42.754 --> 0:34:51.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I'm sorry, I think my laptop is having some Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues, so Bahir, is it possible for you to share the screen? I can walk you through the specifications. 

0:34:52.754 --> 0:34:54.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, yeah, can you? 

0:34:54.754 --> 0:34:59.234 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I shared the API spec in the web chat. 

0:34:57.274 --> 0:34:58.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, OK. 

0:35:18.394 --> 0:35:20.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, let me share my screen. 

0:35:25.274 --> 0:35:27.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You can't see my screen, right? Or it's very. 

0:35:27.714 --> 0:35:29.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we can see. 

0:35:34.154 --> 0:35:35.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, yeah. 

0:35:36.794 --> 0:35:37.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:35:38.74 --> 0:35:46.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So these are all the API specifications that we have create, read, update and delete the templates and template vendor mappings. 

0:35:48.394 --> 0:35:53.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So the first API endpoint we have is for the templates create. It's a post endpoint. 

0:35:55.474 --> 0:36:4.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Here basically we have the Jason structure to gather all the fields that are required to create an entry in the table if you go to the schema. 

0:36:7.394 --> 0:36:8.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You just. 

0:36:8.634 --> 0:36:8.754 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
But. 

0:36:11.234 --> 0:36:12.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You want to go to the screen, OK? 

0:36:13.274 --> 0:36:13.594 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:36:14.794 --> 0:36:34.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, so here we, I mean all these fields represent the TV columns of the master template table and we have some required fields like display name, line of business, template type which we thought were important start date if you think there are any other important fields that we need to be required. 

0:36:15.874 --> 0:36:16.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And. 

0:36:34.154 --> 0:36:35.834 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We can update them. 

0:36:41.234 --> 0:36:41.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You know. 

0:36:43.634 --> 0:36:46.874 
John Drum 
Is this a list of just all the fields in that table? 

0:36:47.514 --> 0:36:47.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yes. 

0:36:55.554 --> 0:37:8.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And some some don't need to be passed, like things like you know, updated timestamp and updated by. Those are just put there so that when we retrieve the entry we we need to provide those values back in the response. 

0:37:12.34 --> 0:37:18.354 
John Drum 
Who's do we have an owner? Oh, yeah, we got the owner department. Yeah, that's there. OK, that's cool. 

0:37:20.914 --> 0:37:36.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And actually master template ID also need to be part of this request. So the idea is if you are creating a new template altogether, we don't need to pass the master template ID, it will be auto-generated. But if you are trying to create a new version. 

0:37:36.754 --> 0:37:40.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Then you can pass an existing master template ID and. 

0:37:37.234 --> 0:37:39.34 
John Drum 
Yeah, of course you would need it then. 

0:37:42.314 --> 0:37:45.834 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Do you think we can auto implement the version or? 

0:37:42.994 --> 0:37:48.34 
John Drum 
And how are you linking them? It's the master template ID that that links them together. 

0:37:49.74 --> 0:37:50.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, correct. 

0:37:50.554 --> 0:37:54.314 
John Drum 
Different versions and then we only have one active flag on all of those. 

0:37:52.674 --> 0:37:52.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yes. 

0:37:56.514 --> 0:38:9.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So the active flag and start date and end date. So if we have a start date mentioned, that template can be used after that point. Let's say if it is 20th December, that template will be used after 20th December, correct? 

0:38:10.194 --> 0:38:13.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh, we also have an active cloud. 

0:38:12.594 --> 0:38:18.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, we do. My question is like, you know, what is the purpose of both? 

0:38:22.314 --> 0:38:26.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Actually we can have both actually start date and end date as well as active flag. 

0:38:29.114 --> 0:38:32.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So only one one template can have be active at a time. 

0:38:35.834 --> 0:38:40.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And and can templates uh overlapping periods like started and ended? 

0:38:36.514 --> 0:38:36.714 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:38:38.394 --> 0:38:39.554 
John Drum 
Is that true? 

0:38:41.634 --> 0:39:0.154 
John Drum 
That's something I don't know. We need to ask. Make a note to query somebody from the FDR team to find out if you can have multiple versions of a shared document active at the same time because active flag. 

0:39:0.554 --> 0:39:16.154 
John Drum 
Only really comes into the only time that you could have more that possibly could be active at the same time would be for shared document for a regular one to one document, you know where it's one document per one. 

0:39:16.514 --> 0:39:32.114 
John Drum 
Account ID instance, then that it doesn't really matter. But when it comes to shared documents that add to flag, we need to know if you can have two different versions of a. 

0:39:33.434 --> 0:39:36.674 
John Drum 
A shared document active at the same time. 

0:39:37.874 --> 0:39:41.514 
John Drum 
And then different accounts pull back different versions. 

0:39:43.314 --> 0:39:47.834 
John Drum 
I don't think they can, but we need to know that for sure. 

0:39:50.834 --> 0:39:52.34 
John Drum 
Because if they. 

0:39:50.874 --> 0:39:54.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And does it apply to the start date and end date also? 

0:39:54.674 --> 0:40:11.474 
John Drum 
Well, that's it could. It could if they can have that. If they don't. If you can't have multiples at the active at the same time, then start date and end date doesn't matter. All you need is the active flag because the one that's active is the only one that should be returned. 

0:39:55.354 --> 0:39:55.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Like can. 

0:40:0.634 --> 0:40:0.754 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:40:12.194 --> 0:40:24.314 
John Drum 
For that template type, right? But if you can have multiples active at any given time, then you need to start and end dates so you know which version to pull back per account. 

0:40:13.74 --> 0:40:13.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:40:27.154 --> 0:40:34.74 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, and in any case, the start date and end date of any two different templates should not overlap, right? 

0:40:35.354 --> 0:40:37.194 
John Drum 
Should never overlap. 

0:40:38.74 --> 0:40:38.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:40:40.594 --> 0:40:44.314 
John Drum 
That's when you get multiple documents come and being returned, and that's a problem. 

0:40:47.554 --> 0:40:52.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, we can probably add a validation whenever we are trying to create an entry. 

0:40:53.154 --> 0:40:54.714 
John Drum 
Yeah, there needs to be. 

0:40:53.474 --> 0:40:55.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
See if there is an overlap and written an error. 

0:40:57.34 --> 0:41:12.394 
John Drum 
But we need to find out if which rule is in effect. So we need to get with somebody because all shared documents come from Fiserv. So we need to ask somebody from the Fiserv team if we can have multiple versions of a shared document active at any given time. 

0:41:12.874 --> 0:41:13.674 
John Drum 
Or a. 

0:41:15.354 --> 0:41:16.754 
John Drum 
You know, different accounts. 

0:41:17.714 --> 0:41:20.394 
John Drum 
Or should it always just be the very latest version? 

0:41:21.594 --> 0:41:21.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:41:23.74 --> 0:41:25.554 
John Drum 
I don't know the answer to that. We need to ask them. 

0:41:26.114 --> 0:41:42.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, and the other was we were debating if we want to pass the version number or not, because if we have a master template ID and if there is an already template existing with that master template ID, we cannot increment the version. 

0:41:42.954 --> 0:41:52.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Or we can just ask consumer to provide a version number and we can validate if it is not a duplicate version, which one do you think would be better? 

0:41:54.554 --> 0:41:55.74 
John Drum 
Mm. 

0:41:58.234 --> 0:42:0.514 
John Drum 
Which one would be better? 

0:42:2.914 --> 0:42:7.994 
John Drum 
I think we should auto generate the version number, but give them the option to change it. 

0:42:8.874 --> 0:42:19.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, so in that case, in the request body we get either master template ID or version. If we get a master template ID, we increment the existing version. 

0:42:20.594 --> 0:42:24.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, we don't need version number at all. Either we get the match template ID or we don't. 

0:42:29.714 --> 0:42:32.74 
John Drum 
Well, what's the scenario you're referring to? 

0:42:33.314 --> 0:42:49.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
No, no. What I'm saying is like if if if it is a brand new template in the request we are expecting only we are expecting neither template ID nor the version. We'll auto generate template ID and then we'll auto generate a version number. 

0:42:33.594 --> 0:42:34.394 
John Drum 
I. 

0:42:49.794 --> 0:42:53.114 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
and next time if they want to create a new version of that. 

0:42:50.834 --> 0:43:1.194 
John Drum 
Yeah, on a on a brand new one, yeah, you only need to worry about modifying the version number on a modify on the very first generate. It's always gonna start with 1.0, right? 

0:42:55.34 --> 0:42:55.234 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:42:58.394 --> 0:42:58.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Correct. 

0:43:2.874 --> 0:43:2.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:43:5.114 --> 0:43:5.234 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:43:9.154 --> 0:43:16.594 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, that's all we have regarding this template request. All the fields are directly related to the columns of the table, so. 

0:43:17.994 --> 0:43:19.874 
John Drum 
And what do you have? Do you have a delete flag? 

0:43:20.834 --> 0:43:30.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
That that was my other question. It's going to be sorted late, so we were wondering if we can use the archive archive field or. 

0:43:21.554 --> 0:43:22.714 
John Drum 
Or is that just your archive? 

0:43:27.674 --> 0:43:27.834 
John Drum 
Right. 

0:43:31.474 --> 0:43:35.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We need a separate flag or I I don't think active flag can be used, but. 

0:43:36.794 --> 0:43:40.674 
John Drum 
No, you can't use the active flag, but I think you can use the archive indicator. 

0:43:37.394 --> 0:43:38.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Either or cable. 

0:43:41.994 --> 0:43:43.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, OK. 

0:43:44.834 --> 0:43:53.154 
John Drum 
And then we just make sure that if it's if that's set for true, then you never return that as part of the query. 

0:43:54.314 --> 0:43:54.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:43:56.274 --> 0:44:2.834 
John Drum 
What's in the record status? Is that the edit status like pending or approved or? 

0:44:3.874 --> 0:44:8.114 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
No, I think that is some DB required column from the. 

0:44:11.354 --> 0:44:11.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, well. 

0:44:14.554 --> 0:44:17.114 
John Drum 
Where do we have our approval status at? 

0:44:21.194 --> 0:44:36.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Remember John, I think we had that approval file column here, but it said you don't need to have it at template master master template definition table. We put it in the vendor mapping table. 

0:44:21.274 --> 0:44:23.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Can you go to the bottom? 

0:44:37.74 --> 0:44:46.474 
John Drum 
We you need in both places because you you're approving the vendor ones also, but you still have a workflow to create the the original one, right? The master also. 

0:44:39.274 --> 0:44:39.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Hey. 

0:44:48.914 --> 0:44:53.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I we we originally had that actually if we if I go to yes. 

0:44:52.394 --> 0:44:53.434 
John Drum 
Are you sure? 

0:44:54.754 --> 0:44:56.314 
John Drum 
Now let's think about it a second. 

0:44:57.394 --> 0:45:2.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, let me see. I think we had this flag. Let me see. 

0:45:3.154 --> 0:45:17.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Template status we had this column but in version 24 you said that for every new version you don't need to have it. So something happened that in the discussion so we didn't move that thing column. 

0:45:17.74 --> 0:45:21.154 
John Drum 
Hmm. OK. But we do have it in the vendor one, right? 

0:45:21.674 --> 0:45:22.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, we have that. 

0:45:24.314 --> 0:45:30.434 
John Drum 
Because probably if if we said that, because you can't really do anything without a vendor record. 

0:45:24.394 --> 0:45:25.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
In the. 

0:45:28.34 --> 0:45:29.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah, we add. 

0:45:33.314 --> 0:45:35.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, this is the same. Yep. 

0:45:34.554 --> 0:45:36.634 
John Drum 
Right. Is that a true statement? 

0:45:39.154 --> 0:45:40.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Come again, John. 

0:45:39.714 --> 0:45:49.634 
John Drum 
What will we plan on doing for vendor records whenever it's generated by, let's say, Fiserv like a statement because we still have to have a template record? 

0:45:52.794 --> 0:45:57.554 
John Drum 
But then again, approval doesn't matter because that's already generated. 

0:45:58.514 --> 0:46:0.314 
John Drum 
Yeah, that'll probably be OK. 

0:46:3.554 --> 0:46:6.794 
John Drum 
We could always add it later if we find out we need it. 

0:46:9.314 --> 0:46:25.994 
John Drum 
Because if I think about it now, usually the pending and approval stuff is what's needed when you're looking at like a new document or a or a modification to a document which is at the vendor level level. The master template shouldn't actually change that often. 

0:46:27.914 --> 0:46:28.154 
John Drum 
Um. 

0:46:31.874 --> 0:46:33.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think that this. 

0:46:32.194 --> 0:46:40.314 
John Drum 
Except for shared documents, but that's the only one I'm a little concerned about is the shared document one. 

0:46:48.34 --> 0:46:49.674 
John Drum 
But we do have a effective date. 

0:46:51.754 --> 0:46:53.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, active flag and. 

0:46:53.954 --> 0:46:55.434 
John Drum 
Is when it becomes active. 

0:46:53.994 --> 0:46:54.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:46:55.474 --> 0:46:57.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Start date and end date. 

0:46:59.154 --> 0:47:9.234 
John Drum 
And these will only be administrative functions anyway, so I think it'll be OK for now. Well, we'll look at it more when we look at the process, but I think it'll be OK. 

0:47:11.514 --> 0:47:15.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. Uh, next where is that window? Yeah, OK. 

0:47:20.274 --> 0:47:26.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, and the next endpoint we have is a get endpoint to retrieve this master templates. 

0:47:28.114 --> 0:47:34.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So we here we have two get endpoints. One, we pass the master complete ID and we retrieve all the versions available. 

0:47:36.234 --> 0:47:36.874 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:47:37.714 --> 0:47:38.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:47:38.954 --> 0:47:52.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And the other one is we have a templates get endpoint. We have some query params that can be sent. For example, we can send a particular template type and all the templates of that type will be retrieved so. 

0:47:41.754 --> 0:47:41.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm. 

0:47:54.634 --> 0:47:58.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We have added a couple of parameters here that we thought may be of use. 

0:47:59.634 --> 0:48:9.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
If you think you know any one of these are not required in the real time scenario, we can get get rid of them or or add a new one. 

0:48:10.234 --> 0:48:17.594 
John Drum 
So what? Let's go on back again. What is this? These are parameters for it, so template type. That's like the. 

0:48:14.914 --> 0:48:15.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Fluttering. 

0:48:16.554 --> 0:48:17.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So if we set up. 

0:48:19.514 --> 0:48:22.714 
John Drum 
OK, so then you have category, what's in the search? 

0:48:24.874 --> 0:48:39.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And the search we're planning like you know if we if we send a keyword, we look through the description or display name, template name. If a keyword matches any of those fields, then we pull those records. 

0:48:39.634 --> 0:48:53.794 
John Drum 
So let me ask you a scenario. So we're creating this draft editor that Backoff is going to use and we need to show all the templates that they're available that they can use to pick to create a a letter, right? 

0:48:46.634 --> 0:48:47.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:48:54.834 --> 0:48:55.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:48:54.914 --> 0:48:55.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:48:55.74 --> 0:48:57.434 
John Drum 
What parameters would I pass to do that? 

0:48:59.794 --> 0:49:11.554 
John Drum 
Because I don't see line of business on here, so I don't want to get letters from, you know, all the templates from different line of businesses. I just want the ones for like credit cards. 

0:49:0.354 --> 0:49:0.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:49:12.274 --> 0:49:13.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, OK. 

0:49:14.354 --> 0:49:16.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we cannot line a business also. 

0:49:14.474 --> 0:49:14.554 
John Drum 
So. 

0:49:16.434 --> 0:49:19.434 
John Drum 
OK, because if we're going to use this to. 

0:49:17.314 --> 0:49:20.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I mean, we were not sure of the actual scenario, so that's why. 

0:49:21.114 --> 0:49:37.554 
John Drum 
Yeah, because you got a little thing about the use cases that we're going to be doing. The first use case would be for like the draft editor that's being created. So back office can actually come in and you know, create letters. So they would list, they would get a list of all the templates that's been defined. 

0:49:21.634 --> 0:49:21.834 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yes. 

0:49:38.114 --> 0:49:53.754 
John Drum 
To start their letter creation process. So but you know you don't want every template in the template database with all the different versions. We would want the latest active version like for a given template. 

0:49:54.514 --> 0:49:58.514 
John Drum 
Per line of business and then possibly. 

0:49:56.154 --> 0:49:56.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:50:0.594 --> 0:50:15.994 
John Drum 
Add us another query as far as department, but not necessarily. So that would be like an optional parameter, but that would give us typically a list of, you know, templates to choose from to start a document creation. 

0:50:20.594 --> 0:50:21.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:50:21.554 --> 0:50:28.314 
John Drum 
So yeah, I think if you add a line of business there and you've got category, but. 

0:50:27.994 --> 0:50:29.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Active and department. 

0:50:29.914 --> 0:50:36.474 
John Drum 
Department. Yeah, I think you need the active in department on there. 

0:50:36.274 --> 0:50:39.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And is sharing, is there something that's useful or? 

0:50:41.314 --> 0:50:42.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Like shared all shared templates. 

0:50:42.194 --> 0:50:45.114 
John Drum 
Uh, shared templates should not be. 

0:50:46.834 --> 0:50:56.434 
John Drum 
Yeah, you should have something that says if it's shared or not. You got that. I think already a shared document though, right? Yeah, that's fine. I would keep that. 

0:50:51.274 --> 0:50:51.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:50:53.554 --> 0:50:54.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:50:58.74 --> 0:51:13.274 
John Drum 
Because we'll use that as a filter when we go to like, they don't do shared documents in the draft editor, so that filter condition would be no. So it doesn't return any of the templates for shared documents, right? 

0:51:14.674 --> 0:51:15.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:51:16.674 --> 0:51:16.954 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:51:19.74 --> 0:51:27.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And all these parameters can be used in conjunction like this particular type and this category. So we pull out the records that's ads for both of them. 

0:51:33.234 --> 0:51:38.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Alright, and then we have to put endpoint that's to make updates. 

0:51:39.514 --> 0:51:41.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
For any entry. 

0:51:43.34 --> 0:51:52.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This we need to have another variable here, sorry path here like version slash diversion ID so differentiates. 

0:51:43.834 --> 0:51:43.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So. 

0:51:52.114 --> 0:51:54.114 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
The template ID slash version we have. 

0:51:54.34 --> 0:52:7.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Templates. No, we need to have one more. What do you call path in here like version slash template version ID kind of. So yeah, path path. Yeah. Segmentation. Yeah, yeah. 

0:52:1.634 --> 0:52:10.834 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. You're talking about a path segment representative to be a version. Okay, okay, got it. Yeah, I I'll do that. 

0:52:12.74 --> 0:52:13.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Good, good, sorry. 

0:52:13.194 --> 0:52:19.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So this will directly target a particular template ID and version and we can update any of the fields that we want. 

0:52:17.34 --> 0:52:17.674 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

0:52:21.994 --> 0:52:22.114 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:52:22.434 --> 0:52:26.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I believe this should be put patch patch, right John? 

0:52:24.994 --> 0:52:36.34 
John Drum 
So question, if we have an audit trail for all these changes, I don't see your passing any kind of ID to like who made the change? How are you doing that? 

0:52:28.114 --> 0:52:29.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

0:52:40.674 --> 0:52:45.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Hmm, I think that those are our header. 

0:52:42.154 --> 0:52:44.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh yeah, we we we. 

0:52:46.354 --> 0:52:54.34 
John Drum 
As we said, this is you're integrating with Active Directory or whatever, right? So from a. 

0:52:51.554 --> 0:52:52.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

0:52:54.954 --> 0:52:59.714 
John Drum 
From a security perspective, how are you limiting? We can call these? 

0:53:1.714 --> 0:53:2.474 
John Drum 
APIs. 

0:53:3.394 --> 0:53:6.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This will be an identifier like yeah. 

0:53:7.874 --> 0:53:16.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We have this correlation ID and we call it requester ID and those stuff right in the other endpoints we need to add those things here too. 

0:53:9.514 --> 0:53:9.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So it. 

0:53:16.794 --> 0:53:16.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:53:17.154 --> 0:53:26.74 
John Drum 
You know what I'm getting at, right? Because we want to make first we want the audit trail and then we want to make sure not just anybody can sit down with postman and start calling these things. 

0:53:18.114 --> 0:53:18.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:53:19.634 --> 0:53:19.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
You. 

0:53:29.394 --> 0:53:30.594 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:53:33.714 --> 0:53:43.594 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we'll add, we'll add those. I think they're probably header parameters identifying where is the request coming from and I believe we can pull. 

0:53:40.674 --> 0:53:40.954 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:53:42.754 --> 0:53:54.834 
John Drum 
The identifier, the request. I would make that optional. I wouldn't make it forced, but it should be there so that you know if we have it, we can log it as part of the the log, the audit log. 

0:53:53.34 --> 0:53:53.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:53:54.834 --> 0:53:57.834 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, sure. We'll add that. 

0:54:0.154 --> 0:54:6.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, I believe John, this should be a patch one, right? You should be able to do a update only. 

0:54:5.114 --> 0:54:8.434 
John Drum 
For the modify, I would have thought it was a patch, yeah. 

0:54:9.714 --> 0:54:17.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So we we should only be able to modify certain fields and not change other fields. So yeah, it should be a patch. 

0:54:17.994 --> 0:54:19.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, yeah, I'll update that. 

0:54:18.194 --> 0:54:22.554 
John Drum 
We got like the template ID. You can't modify that, right? 

0:54:23.354 --> 0:54:24.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, yeah. 

0:54:23.714 --> 0:54:25.354 
John Drum 
Because then you would break everything. 

0:54:26.34 --> 0:54:26.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:54:28.354 --> 0:54:33.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You can't update these two fields, right? And even even the unique identifiers. 

0:54:30.594 --> 0:54:32.234 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:54:34.994 --> 0:54:37.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
My line of business and all the stuff. 

0:54:38.834 --> 0:54:41.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Look I I'll update this input. 

0:54:49.74 --> 0:54:49.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And the. 

0:54:50.74 --> 0:55:5.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, and then we have this delete endpoint. Again, we pass a template version and it's a soft delete, so we'll use the archive indicator field. If something is being deleted, we update the timestamp, archive timestamp and. 

0:55:5.714 --> 0:55:6.154 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:55:5.874 --> 0:55:7.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I feel true. 

0:55:8.474 --> 0:55:8.794 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:55:11.714 --> 0:55:21.834 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And we have the template vendors endpoints, same format, the quick body changed. Now here all the fields represent the template vendor mapping columns. 

0:55:26.514 --> 0:55:29.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Uh, can you go to schema here? 

0:55:33.634 --> 0:55:43.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Here also the template ID version vendor and the template key reference key type start date. We have made all these as required fields. 

0:55:37.714 --> 0:55:38.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Are required. 

0:55:45.394 --> 0:55:49.794 
John Drum 
Which field did we set aside to show which one was the default? 

0:55:51.754 --> 0:55:57.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
That one is a primary flag or active flag? There are primary flag probably. 

0:55:54.954 --> 0:55:55.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm. 

0:55:57.914 --> 0:55:58.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So. 

0:55:59.154 --> 0:56:2.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Which vendor is the primary one, right, John? 

0:56:2.834 --> 0:56:15.394 
John Drum 
Yeah, because, well, yeah. So if there's like two different vendors for a given template and they don't pass which one to use, we're going to use one by default, which which field did we set aside for that? 

0:56:18.514 --> 0:56:22.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Primarily, I think it's that's primary factor. 

0:56:27.474 --> 0:56:29.274 
John Drum 
Well, that just says. 

0:56:31.34 --> 0:56:34.834 
John Drum 
It doesn't indicate that on your description. Now you need to update that. 

0:56:33.794 --> 0:56:34.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:56:37.954 --> 0:56:42.354 
John Drum 
Because when they go to do the draft editor. 

0:56:44.994 --> 0:56:48.154 
John Drum 
If there's multiple vendors available for that template. 

0:56:49.234 --> 0:56:50.394 
John Drum 
We should indicate that. 

0:56:51.954 --> 0:56:54.794 
John Drum 
So they can pick which rint vendor they want to print that. 

0:57:1.634 --> 0:57:8.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Let's see, did I build that now? This is lecture one. 

0:57:9.794 --> 0:57:14.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, I did. I didn't do that just for this part. OK, I'll do that. 

0:57:19.74 --> 0:57:21.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, so this, yeah. 

0:57:22.994 --> 0:57:27.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, and here we have the template status. Uh, like the app editing. 

0:57:27.274 --> 0:57:28.834 
John Drum 
Whether it's approved or not. 

0:57:29.274 --> 0:57:31.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, last speed. 

0:57:34.754 --> 0:57:34.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

0:57:35.754 --> 0:57:40.754 
John Drum 
And that primary flag cannot be set unless it's in an approved status, right? 

0:57:41.834 --> 0:57:42.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

0:57:43.274 --> 0:57:49.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah, make this. So unless we this. 

0:57:47.274 --> 0:57:54.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So yeah, it should be a condition that primary cannot be set to true unless until the status is approved. 

0:57:54.514 --> 0:57:54.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:57:54.634 --> 0:57:55.74 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

0:58:6.554 --> 0:58:9.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, and we have get 10 points. 

0:58:10.954 --> 0:58:14.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Save As for our templates. Yeah, right. 

0:58:11.314 --> 0:58:11.794 
John Drum 
So. 

0:58:13.194 --> 0:58:14.434 
John Drum 
Go back down again. 

0:58:19.634 --> 0:58:21.314 
John Drum 
Which one did you say was the status? 

0:58:22.394 --> 0:58:24.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
The last one template status. 

0:58:22.874 --> 0:58:23.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Your. 

0:58:23.834 --> 0:58:26.114 
John Drum 
Bottom one, right? The template status. 

0:58:25.754 --> 0:58:26.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

0:58:30.434 --> 0:58:30.554 
John Drum 
OK. 

0:58:30.874 --> 0:58:34.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I think this should be renamed to vendors template status, right? 

0:58:35.354 --> 0:58:37.794 
John Drum 
It's for that particular vendor, yes. 

0:58:36.194 --> 0:58:37.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Enter. 

0:58:36.514 --> 0:58:37.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yes. 

0:58:38.234 --> 0:58:38.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

0:58:41.674 --> 0:58:48.754 
John Drum 
Because that's why it confused me for a minute because when I say template, I'm thinking master template, but it's just it's for this specific vendor. 

0:58:46.794 --> 0:58:51.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah. Vendors vendor template status, yeah. 

0:59:3.554 --> 0:59:3.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Schema. 

0:59:6.994 --> 0:59:7.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Sure. 

0:59:11.394 --> 0:59:14.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Don't need to pass this, this will be auto generated. 

0:59:15.954 --> 0:59:16.74 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

0:59:18.754 --> 0:59:21.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh no, this is OK. This is this should be coming from the. 

0:59:23.114 --> 0:59:24.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, vendor right so. 

0:59:28.314 --> 0:59:29.74 
John Drum 
Yeah, is it that? 

0:59:33.34 --> 0:59:46.834 
John Drum 
Well, I guess it depends on where what's your your template keys. You got like reference keys, vendor template keys. I don't know what all of them are referencing off the top of my head just looking at this. That's why you need that data dictionary. 

0:59:51.314 --> 0:59:51.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

0:59:54.714 --> 1:0:3.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I didn't concentrate much on this table, so probably need to get sit down and revisit it again. 

1:0:8.434 --> 1:0:8.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

1:0:16.874 --> 1:0:18.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, uh, so. 

1:0:21.314 --> 1:0:21.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
We have. 

1:0:22.314 --> 1:0:28.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we we have get end points the same way we have a couple of. 

1:0:29.194 --> 1:0:32.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Very parameters here based on vendor whether it is active or not. 

1:0:34.594 --> 1:0:34.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Uh. 

1:0:36.674 --> 1:0:43.74 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
If it is a primary or not, we can pass these fields and direct to those particular template vendor mappings. 

1:0:42.394 --> 1:0:52.794 
John Drum 
So if I just want to call this to say, get me the default vendor for this template, what parameters would I pass? 

1:0:50.114 --> 1:0:50.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Please. 

1:0:53.354 --> 1:0:55.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Is primitive true and. 

1:0:56.834 --> 1:0:57.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Is active. 

1:0:57.314 --> 1:0:59.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, you want for a particular template? 

1:1:0.474 --> 1:1:0.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

1:1:0.714 --> 1:1:15.674 
John Drum 
Well, I mean, I don't know the vendors that are when I'm coming from a a UI perspective, all I know is this is my template. I don't know which vendors is belong to that template yet. So if I want to know what's the. 

1:1:7.314 --> 1:1:7.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:1:16.154 --> 1:1:21.754 
John Drum 
Default vendor for this template. What parameters would I pass to this? 

1:1:23.514 --> 1:1:30.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I think we need to add our template type for category here, but that would require us merging those two tables. 

1:1:29.354 --> 1:1:36.794 
John Drum 
We already know your template. You already know the template. These are just child records off of that template, right? 

1:1:33.754 --> 1:1:34.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Only have them. 

1:1:36.474 --> 1:1:41.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah yeah you have to do like this way like template slash template master template ID. 

1:1:37.554 --> 1:1:38.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Correct. 

1:1:43.594 --> 1:1:48.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Then followed by slash template windows so. 

1:1:50.314 --> 1:1:53.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You will have to have the reference to the master template ID here. 

1:1:52.314 --> 1:1:55.954 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, so so you're saying we can just use master template ID? 

1:1:55.914 --> 1:1:56.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Slash yeah. 

1:1:57.274 --> 1:2:6.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
uh We retrieve all the mappings for that particular template. We don't need to look look up the types and category. 

1:2:1.34 --> 1:2:4.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, slash template windows, so it. 

1:2:6.714 --> 1:2:21.314 
John Drum 
No, because yeah, you don't need to do that. That would never happen. You're you're going to want to know the master templates for like a category, but not the vendor templates. The vendor templates only comes into play once you have the master template. 

1:2:11.234 --> 1:2:12.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, OK. 

1:2:23.554 --> 1:2:34.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, then we can have a we can have an endpoint or we can have a query param here itself that takes a master template ID. 

1:2:32.434 --> 1:2:35.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No, I believe should have something like this. 

1:2:38.834 --> 1:2:40.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So like uh. 

1:2:42.74 --> 1:2:42.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Slash templates. 

1:2:44.514 --> 1:2:46.74 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah. 

1:2:46.274 --> 1:2:46.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Master template. 

1:2:47.34 --> 1:2:52.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
That's what you're saying. It's going to be another end point if we go with that approach since. 

1:2:48.754 --> 1:2:49.434 
John Drum 
No. 

1:2:51.674 --> 1:2:58.274 
John Drum 
There could be some reports and stuff that where you want to go just find give me all the vendor templates for let's say Smartcom. 

1:2:51.954 --> 1:2:52.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Slash. 

1:3:0.354 --> 1:3:2.314 
John Drum 
So you can see what's been created. 

1:3:11.594 --> 1:3:14.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, you mean to what? What is that John like? 

1:3:14.314 --> 1:3:31.874 
John Drum 
So I'm just thinking through the different scenarios, right? Most of the time I I have my master ID, my master template and I want to know what my vendor templates off of it are. But there could be some other cases where just for maintenance type of stuff I'm going to say. 

1:3:16.554 --> 1:3:17.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:3:21.274 --> 1:3:21.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

1:3:24.914 --> 1:3:25.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

1:3:32.514 --> 1:3:35.474 
John Drum 
OK, what templates do I have? 

1:3:38.594 --> 1:3:42.314 
John Drum 
Created a vendor template for Real Estate Smart Home. 

1:3:43.354 --> 1:3:46.74 
John Drum 
And then get a list of the templates back from that. 

1:3:43.554 --> 1:3:43.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
M. 

1:3:43.994 --> 1:3:45.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, that. 

1:3:47.354 --> 1:3:52.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, that can be done through this gate endpoint. We have a vendor query panel which will take. 

1:3:54.714 --> 1:3:55.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Window ID. 

1:3:55.354 --> 1:3:56.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, this one. 

1:3:55.434 --> 1:3:59.674 
John Drum 
And does that return value from that also return the master template ID? 

1:3:59.834 --> 1:4:3.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, it'll get the match template ID also in the response. 

1:4:2.794 --> 1:4:6.194 
John Drum 
OK, so you want to keep that. You don't want to get rid of it. 

1:4:3.194 --> 1:4:3.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:4:7.194 --> 1:4:9.754 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, So what I'm asking is. 

1:4:7.394 --> 1:4:9.914 
John Drum 
You just need to add some more stuff to give you. 

1:4:10.714 --> 1:4:24.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, for a particular template ID to get all the mappings, do you think we can we go with a new endpoint that takes the master template ID in the path parameter or we can just add master template ID as a query parameter in the same get endpoint? 

1:4:14.434 --> 1:4:14.914 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

1:4:23.754 --> 1:4:27.874 
John Drum 
I would make it as an optional query parameter, but that's just me. 

1:4:24.394 --> 1:4:25.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
No. 

1:4:32.34 --> 1:4:32.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:4:34.634 --> 1:4:35.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And uh. 

1:4:34.634 --> 1:4:38.754 
John Drum 
You thought it sounded like you had some ideas down here. 

1:4:39.794 --> 1:4:42.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, yeah, we could. Um. 

1:4:43.914 --> 1:4:45.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, we could go either way, but. 

1:4:47.994 --> 1:4:51.954 
John Drum 
Think about your use cases. Where would you use it one way or the other? 

1:4:57.994 --> 1:5:13.314 
John Drum 
The use case I was giving was OK, we're we're going to be going through this massive undertaking of migrating our our templates from you know, Ascentis and LPS over to Smartcom, so. 

1:5:13.594 --> 1:5:28.274 
John Drum 
I I want to know the progress we've made so far, which templates have we already done. So then I would go in and you know, say, OK, give me all the templates that have been done by Smartcom and then get that list back so I know what's been done and what's not. 

1:5:19.754 --> 1:5:20.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:5:29.154 --> 1:5:42.994 
John Drum 
Different scenarios. I'm actually inside my draft editor. I'm working on a template. I get ready to print it and it comes up and say do you want to use the default print vendor or do you want to use one of the others? 

1:5:36.34 --> 1:5:36.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mom. 

1:5:44.314 --> 1:6:1.834 
John Drum 
And if they do nothing, we'll select the default. Otherwise they can choose one of the other print vendors and we'll pass that as part of the API to to force to go down that path. So like I said, whenever I think of things, I try to think through this scenario to see what we need the APIs to do. 

1:5:44.434 --> 1:5:44.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:6:1.754 --> 1:6:1.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
1. 

1:6:5.314 --> 1:6:10.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, uh, but if if we add multiple optional fields, that query get complicated. 

1:6:13.354 --> 1:6:20.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So we're doing much many things in the same same MP endpoint, so I would rather prefer to have it separate. 

1:6:18.514 --> 1:6:18.754 
John Drum 
Yeah. 

1:6:20.794 --> 1:6:29.554 
John Drum 
And that's fine. Like I said, I'm letting you guys design how you want those endpoints to look. I'm just telling you to temp the scenarios that we need to solve for. 

1:6:21.354 --> 1:6:22.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah. 

1:6:28.874 --> 1:6:29.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:6:30.474 --> 1:6:30.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

1:6:31.914 --> 1:6:38.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, OK, then I'll create a new endpoint which takes match template and returns all the mappings for that particular template. 

1:6:39.314 --> 1:6:39.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

1:6:40.714 --> 1:6:52.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, and one more thing, when we're creating this mapping, so when a mapping is created, it's going to be in draft version, right? Unless until it goes to the data flow and gets approved. 

1:6:52.474 --> 1:7:2.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, workflow. Yeah, yeah, it could. It would go through the workflow and then it. So for that we need to have an endpoint to change the status. 

1:7:0.394 --> 1:7:4.874 
John Drum 
Well, you need to fill. That needs to be a filter condition that's optional. 

1:7:5.874 --> 1:7:6.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:7:6.474 --> 1:7:11.354 
John Drum 
Because I may want to return all the the vendor templates that are in a pending condition. 

1:7:12.354 --> 1:7:30.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking the same. And another thing is, so let's say once a template vendor mapping is approved, let's say it's like for a template that is the only mapping we have and make it primary. Do we have to make a separate and? 

1:7:15.834 --> 1:7:15.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh. 

1:7:31.434 --> 1:7:43.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah, we need to have an endpoint. We need to have another separate endpoint so that that could change the status of the particular endpoint or make it a primary. 

1:7:32.354 --> 1:7:33.954 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
How do we want to? 

1:7:44.434 --> 1:7:48.394 
John Drum 
Or you can use your patch end point to just modify that field. 

1:7:45.874 --> 1:7:45.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

1:7:45.954 --> 1:7:48.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, patch endpoint can be used. 

1:7:48.194 --> 1:7:52.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep, patch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can use a patching. Yep, that should work, yeah. 

1:7:55.194 --> 1:7:55.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:7:58.994 --> 1:8:5.954 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
And we have one get point that will just take the template one to mapping ID and returns that particular entry. 

1:8:7.314 --> 1:8:7.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:8:9.994 --> 1:8:12.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
It's going to be a single entry returned back. 

1:8:17.74 --> 1:8:17.754 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:8:18.914 --> 1:8:23.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Next we have put here. I'll update that to be a patch and 

1:8:22.554 --> 1:8:28.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, there this could return an arrange, Jagdish, because there could be multiple versions, right? 

1:8:32.234 --> 1:8:36.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
If you're just putting a vendor template ID here, template vendor ID. 

1:8:37.954 --> 1:8:48.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Thing there could be a list of versions that that might be what you called inactive or not. 

1:8:39.34 --> 1:8:39.74 
John Drum 
Oh. 

1:8:47.674 --> 1:8:51.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, I thought. I thought template vendor ID is a unique field. 

1:8:52.754 --> 1:8:53.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mm. 

1:8:53.154 --> 1:9:6.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
For example, if there is a change to what you call something, oh, there could be a new version template, right? So for example, a few variables were added to the template, so we have a new version for that. 

1:9:7.434 --> 1:9:7.914 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:9:9.154 --> 1:9:13.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, in the vendor template ID, so we'll be adding that to. 

1:9:14.434 --> 1:9:14.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

1:9:15.714 --> 1:9:18.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, the new version, right? So. 

1:9:19.874 --> 1:9:21.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We might have a new version here. 

1:9:20.354 --> 1:9:20.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. 

1:9:22.434 --> 1:9:30.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, yeah, we might have a new version, but I thought this would be an auto generated field that is not in combination. 

1:9:32.754 --> 1:9:34.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Of the unique keys for this table. 

1:9:32.954 --> 1:9:44.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
What do you think John? So this is for vendor specific, sorry vendor specific records John. 

1:9:35.434 --> 1:9:41.314 
John Drum 
Is this for which? Which API is this? Is this the? 

1:9:43.714 --> 1:9:50.234 
John Drum 
I know, but is this the the generate the patch or the which which one are we looking at? 

1:9:49.874 --> 1:9:52.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Get we're getting get. 

1:9:50.954 --> 1:9:51.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Get. Get. 

1:9:52.594 --> 1:10:2.274 
John Drum 
To get it, there could be multiples, because what could happen is you may have two or three different versions of a letter and they're all active. 

1:10:1.914 --> 1:10:2.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:10:4.834 --> 1:10:13.754 
John Drum 
Because this is different than shared documents, and when I say versions, it could be though the only difference in the versions is the header and footer. 

1:10:8.154 --> 1:10:8.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:10:16.594 --> 1:10:34.434 
John Drum 
You know, so any of that can be used. It's just when they go to create their draft in the draft editor, they pick which version they want to use for a given situation, right? So it's definitely going to be possible that there could be more than one version that's active. 

1:10:35.34 --> 1:10:37.114 
John Drum 
For a non shared document. 

1:10:40.354 --> 1:10:55.274 
John Drum 
When they go to edit it, they have to tell which version that they're editing. That's why I say this wouldn't necessarily be auto-generated. They need to pass that value for this. We can auto-generate a value to stick in it, but. 

1:10:40.594 --> 1:10:43.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, but but when the mapping is. 

1:10:55.634 --> 1:11:14.434 
John Drum 
Because when they're modifying something, we're not creating a new version automatically. They're modifying that version, especially when this isn't approved yet. You know, this may go through three or four different iterations before it's approved. You don't want that version number to get incremented every single time. 

1:11:15.114 --> 1:11:15.194 
John Drum 
Um. 

1:11:17.634 --> 1:11:21.794 
John Drum 
The only time that the version number should be incremented is on an approval. 

1:11:22.874 --> 1:11:28.234 
John Drum 
And then I would give them the option to increment it or use the same one. 

1:11:32.354 --> 1:11:35.554 
John Drum 
Am I making sense to you guys or am I confusing you? 

1:11:36.834 --> 1:11:41.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I'm a little bit confused, so here we're talking about the template window. 

1:11:39.194 --> 1:11:40.994 
John Drum 
So let's say that we have. 

1:11:42.634 --> 1:11:51.74 
John Drum 
Yes. So we got the template vendor. We have three different versions of the letter, right? With different footers. 

1:11:43.314 --> 1:11:44.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, go ahead. 

1:11:50.74 --> 1:11:50.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Right. 

1:11:52.714 --> 1:11:53.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:11:53.634 --> 1:12:9.34 
John Drum 
And they have different version numbers for the different footers, but they're from the same vendor. It's the same document, it's just got different footers. So they want to go back and modify a misspelling on. 

1:12:0.74 --> 1:12:0.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:12:9.714 --> 1:12:28.754 
John Drum 
You know, one of the previous versions, well, they want to fix that, but they don't want to increment the version because that's the version that you know everybody knows to use to get that footer. So we had to let them do a modify without actually incrementing the version number. But if they want to increment it, we should allow them. 

1:12:9.754 --> 1:12:10.234 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:12:21.434 --> 1:12:21.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:12:29.314 --> 1:12:39.554 
John Drum 
Because basically at that point, if they do increment it, they're creating a whole new version that they should use in the past and not use that old version anymore. So we need to give them the ability to do either one. 

1:12:38.634 --> 1:12:39.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, but but. 

1:12:41.794 --> 1:12:54.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So updating this version number like not version number, updating this fields or whatever you're talking about, updating the template, that update is going to take place in the master template table, correct? 

1:12:54.754 --> 1:13:0.114 
John Drum 
No, no, no. The version number for the vendor is different than the version number for the master template. 

1:13:2.794 --> 1:13:7.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Oh, but here, can you go to the table once? Go ahead. 

1:13:14.274 --> 1:13:16.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, so here in this template vendor mapping. 

1:13:18.34 --> 1:13:23.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
The master template ID and template version we have here are the foreign keys that. 

1:13:23.634 --> 1:13:25.114 
John Drum 
Yeah, those don't get. 

1:13:24.474 --> 1:13:25.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Map entry. 

1:13:26.354 --> 1:13:28.74 
John Drum 
Yeah, those don't get modified. 

1:13:26.914 --> 1:13:27.34 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Good. 

1:13:29.554 --> 1:13:44.954 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Correct. So now the question is the template vendor ID the the first field. So every time a mapping is created for a particular template ID and a particular version, we want to auto generate it to be a unique one. 

1:13:45.394 --> 1:13:51.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Or do you think the match template ID, template version, untemplate vendor ID or a unique combination? 

1:13:50.914 --> 1:14:1.514 
John Drum 
Oh, I I don't think you can use the master exemplate version number in the vendor one. Otherwise you have to create new vendor records every time you create a new version for the master. 

1:14:5.954 --> 1:14:18.994 
John Drum 
If you use that combination of the template ID and template version as a like a primary key, anytime you change the version number in the master, you have to create all new vendor records, right? 

1:14:22.834 --> 1:14:27.314 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yes, but uh, in the master template, the combination of those two is uh. 

1:14:28.474 --> 1:14:30.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Primary key for us, yeah. 

1:14:28.674 --> 1:14:29.994 
John Drum 
It's unique, right? 

1:14:34.314 --> 1:14:35.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
It's unique. 

1:14:36.634 --> 1:14:41.194 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Well, let's say we have a template ID one and what? Yeah, yeah, go ahead. 

1:14:36.634 --> 1:14:53.354 
John Drum 
So are you going to? So you can do that under one scenario if you give them the option to carry over whenever they bring a new version of the master template and it's got vendor records assigned. 

1:14:51.234 --> 1:14:51.754 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:14:53.954 --> 1:15:1.114 
John Drum 
You need to give them the option to copy vendor records over to the new master version number. 

1:15:3.634 --> 1:15:11.234 
John Drum 
Because they're not going to want to go through and recreate all those vendor records just because they've incremented the vendor, the version number in the master. 

1:15:15.154 --> 1:15:16.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Right. Yeah. 

1:15:19.714 --> 1:15:34.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So Tahir, what was the original idea like? Like let's say when a new version is created, I I was in the mindset that a new vendor mapping also has to be created, maybe copying from the old mapping or make a new. 

1:15:30.674 --> 1:15:30.994 
John Drum 
But. 

1:15:33.314 --> 1:15:49.994 
John Drum 
That's fine. Like I said it cause the way you're set up it that has to happen because if you have the version number as part of the primary key changing it, it's going to change primary key and it would break all the child records. So that means you need to create new records to tie back to that new. 

1:15:35.34 --> 1:15:35.594 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Request. 

1:15:49.194 --> 1:15:49.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Correct. 

1:15:50.554 --> 1:16:5.74 
John Drum 
Template version number and that's that's fine to do, but we need to do that automatically. We can't make the the whoever's using the system go through and recreate all those vendor records. That would just make the the system a pain in the ***. 

1:16:5.634 --> 1:16:14.874 
John Drum 
So anytime that that version numbers in the master template is incremented, we need to give them an option to carry over. 

1:16:15.634 --> 1:16:35.74 
John Drum 
The previous versions, vendor records to the new version and then they may need to go in and edit whatever they need to. But otherwise, you know, maybe they've got three different vendors that's already set up for it. We don't want them to have to go through and fill out all that information over again just because they implemented the master. 

1:16:35.154 --> 1:16:43.994 
John Drum 
Template because it could be a modification that has nothing to do with the vendor specific piece. So why make them recreate that you know? 

1:16:42.474 --> 1:16:43.434 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, got that so. 

1:16:45.34 --> 1:16:50.634 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, we need to make a copy of all those 3 records and port them to the new version as well. 

1:16:50.754 --> 1:16:54.274 
John Drum 
Yes, that's fine. Yeah. And then what we were doing would work. 

1:16:56.834 --> 1:17:0.114 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, so in this scenario attempt. 

1:16:58.354 --> 1:17:5.34 
John Drum 
But my point before when we were discussion was not the linkage back to the master, it was for the vendor record itself. 

1:17:4.74 --> 1:17:4.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Mhm. 

1:17:5.754 --> 1:17:6.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Correct. 

1:17:6.594 --> 1:17:9.394 
John Drum 
So you have a version of the vendor record, right? 

1:17:11.754 --> 1:17:14.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Uh, when you go back to the table, Tahir. 

1:17:24.554 --> 1:17:27.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, vendor mapping version you're talking about, right? 

1:17:27.714 --> 1:17:42.754 
John Drum 
Yes. So for the vendor record, this has a version also, right? Yeah, vendor mapping version. So this they need to have the option to either keep the version or increment the version. 

1:17:29.554 --> 1:17:31.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Will you enter it? 

1:17:45.874 --> 1:17:45.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:17:46.994 --> 1:17:48.74 
John Drum 
Either one. 

1:17:50.514 --> 1:18:2.154 
John Drum 
Because this, unlike the master, you know the master can only have basically one of them active at a time. Vendors. You can have multiple vendors active. 

1:18:6.554 --> 1:18:6.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:18:10.354 --> 1:18:14.914 
John Drum 
You know, you may have three different versions that are all valid that they could choose from. 

1:18:19.34 --> 1:18:30.154 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK, got it. And Taher, we we can discuss about the template when ready being, whether it being unique or not, but I think it should be unique with respect to the version. 

1:18:31.634 --> 1:18:34.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Because it's an auto generated for each mapping entry. 

1:18:34.754 --> 1:18:37.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Vendor template which one? 

1:18:36.914 --> 1:18:39.674 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Template vendor ID the first column. 

1:18:40.274 --> 1:18:43.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
This this this this would be unique for each record in this table. 

1:18:45.274 --> 1:18:54.874 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. So that's what I'm talking in the get end point that I was talking earlier. This is the field that we were expecting there. So it's not going to be a multiple entries in that get end point. 

1:18:56.474 --> 1:19:1.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. Yeah, you're right. 

1:19:1.994 --> 1:19:2.714 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Focus. 

1:19:5.954 --> 1:19:8.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Can you go back to the spec? 

1:19:9.954 --> 1:19:11.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:19:13.34 --> 1:19:23.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah. OK. So those are the gate points we have and yeah, we'll be adding a new one and then we have a patch to update one and then delete. 

1:19:24.794 --> 1:19:25.434 
John Drum 
Mhm. 

1:19:25.74 --> 1:19:39.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
It's again going to be a soft delete. We'll be using that indicator field and I believe since we have a separate status field in this table, whenever we delete something, do you think the status also need to be changed to our correct? 

1:19:40.394 --> 1:19:40.874 
John Drum 
To what? 

1:19:41.554 --> 1:19:45.394 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So we have a template status field. I like template when mapping status. 

1:19:46.234 --> 1:19:50.434 
John Drum 
Oh you yes, you should change the status to archive when you do the other field archive. 

1:19:51.434 --> 1:19:51.554 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:19:53.514 --> 1:19:56.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah, you have. 

1:19:57.274 --> 1:19:59.514 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
I think those are all the endpoints that we have. 

1:20:11.354 --> 1:20:14.794 
John Drum 
So can you go back to the master template again? 

1:20:23.714 --> 1:20:27.354 
John Drum 
What field in here tells me that this is a letter versus an e-mail? 

1:20:30.594 --> 1:20:32.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Take this. 

1:20:43.34 --> 1:20:46.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Will this be sufficient to differentiate so? 

1:20:46.314 --> 1:20:52.554 
John Drum 
No, it needs to be something that can be queried to say I want to see all my e-mail templates. 

1:20:55.74 --> 1:20:59.514 
John Drum 
If you put it in there, that's gonna be a a very long running query. 

1:21:2.274 --> 1:21:7.354 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
So so the mode of delivery is based on template, it's not based on vendor. 

1:21:11.34 --> 1:21:11.114 
John Drum 
So. 

1:21:13.394 --> 1:21:26.314 
John Drum 
Can you? Maybe I'm not seeing this right? Zoom in a little bit better because half of what you're showing me is fuzzy here. OK, so these are these are the channels for a given template, right? 

1:21:18.394 --> 1:21:18.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, sure. 

1:21:26.794 --> 1:21:27.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

1:21:31.554 --> 1:21:34.234 
John Drum 
And then your vendor tells you which channel it's in. 

1:21:36.394 --> 1:21:40.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
If vendor tells us in what channel? 

1:21:39.714 --> 1:21:48.234 
John Drum 
As you're saying, I got a master template and it can go to a letter and it can go to the the um, what was the other one? 

1:21:50.594 --> 1:21:51.914 
John Drum 
Let's say it's e-mail. 

1:21:51.914 --> 1:21:52.274 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
E-mail. 

1:21:54.234 --> 1:21:59.154 
John Drum 
Now the way that's formatted and everything is going to be based upon the channel. 

1:22:4.314 --> 1:22:7.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think we need to add a column that differentiates. 

1:22:9.234 --> 1:22:11.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That in the window. 

1:22:10.914 --> 1:22:17.434 
John Drum 
Because I thought that column is where it could be supported, but if I'm trying to actually return because you know we're going to be. 

1:22:23.914 --> 1:22:24.234 
John Drum 
The. 

1:22:26.674 --> 1:22:31.274 
John Drum 
Yeah, I'm sitting here thinking second guessing myself here. Give me a second. 

1:22:40.74 --> 1:22:42.394 
John Drum 
Scroll down to the channel again. 

1:22:48.194 --> 1:22:50.794 
John Drum 
This is in the master, not the the vendor, right? 

1:22:50.194 --> 1:22:52.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Not in, not in the window here. 

1:23:4.434 --> 1:23:19.74 
John Drum 
Because see this, this tells me this is a channel. It's not the type of template because it's saying OK this. Let's say that this is a letter. This letter can be emailed, it can be printed, or it could be displayed on the web. 

1:23:18.914 --> 1:23:19.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:23:20.594 --> 1:23:27.234 
John Drum 
But I have a template that I'm actually is my e-mail template, not a letter to be emailed. 

1:23:27.194 --> 1:23:28.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:23:28.394 --> 1:23:31.674 
John Drum 
So this template I'm going to be sending to. 

1:23:33.634 --> 1:23:40.394 
John Drum 
Salesforce, right? My vendor for this template will be Salesforce, not Smartcom or whatever. 

1:23:41.394 --> 1:23:42.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:23:45.74 --> 1:23:55.834 
John Drum 
This the fact that it says e-mail doesn't tell me that this is a basically a Salesforce template versus one that's for just printed letters. 

1:23:55.914 --> 1:23:56.874 
John Drum 
Good letters. 

1:23:57.954 --> 1:24:13.514 
John Drum 
So I think you need another field that differentiates the fact that this template is meant to do printed communications, regardless of how you're going to send that printed communication. You know, it may be. 

1:24:13.794 --> 1:24:16.394 
John Drum 
Have all these channels true? 

1:24:17.834 --> 1:24:22.794 
John Drum 
As a printed communication letters versus an e-mail only one. 

1:24:24.754 --> 1:24:26.914 
John Drum 
That the type would only be e-mail. 

1:24:29.394 --> 1:24:30.554 
John Drum 
Then all this information. 

1:24:32.274 --> 1:24:44.834 
John Drum 
Is pertinent to the e-mail body, not to an attachment that goes on the e-mail. Because if this channel is e-mail, that means it's an attachment for an e-mail, right? 

1:24:45.274 --> 1:24:48.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, could. Yep, Yep. Mm-hmm. 

1:24:46.314 --> 1:24:47.434 
John Drum 
The letter itself. 

1:24:48.834 --> 1:24:55.674 
John Drum 
Versus the other template I'm talking about would be the body of the e-mail. When you create it, attachment could be a separate thing. 

1:24:57.234 --> 1:25:12.794 
John Drum 
Because eventually we want to use the same template system for more than just letters. We also want to use it for the e-mail delivery and it could be for push. So for that type it could be like letter. 

1:25:0.914 --> 1:25:1.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. 

1:25:13.394 --> 1:25:19.194 
John Drum 
E-mail, SMS, you know, different types of communication. 

1:25:20.594 --> 1:25:25.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, that should be at master template definition, right? 

1:25:25.274 --> 1:25:27.634 
John Drum 
That's at the master template level. 

1:25:28.114 --> 1:25:30.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Type of communication, OK. 

1:25:29.954 --> 1:25:44.434 
John Drum 
Because then all the vendors off of that master would be just for that type, like it would just be for e-mail body. What vendors can do that? Well, so far all we got is Salesforce, but it could be Exchange or could be some other e-mail vendor in the future, right? Those would be your vendor. 

1:25:44.234 --> 1:25:44.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:25:46.514 --> 1:25:57.154 
John Drum 
Specific ones for that type and like SMS that would be air. Was it airship? I think we use but if we ever have any other push ones. 

1:25:48.594 --> 1:25:49.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:25:58.754 --> 1:26:4.834 
John Drum 
Or, you know, there's SMS and then there's push notifications too, so there could be some different types. 

1:26:6.634 --> 1:26:8.794 
John Drum 
That we would have templates for. 

1:26:13.394 --> 1:26:17.474 
John Drum 
And this structure should still work for that. 

1:26:23.34 --> 1:26:25.274 
John Drum 
That's why we've made it so configurable. 

1:26:28.114 --> 1:26:28.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:26:31.594 --> 1:26:32.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

1:26:36.394 --> 1:26:37.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So print. 

1:26:40.194 --> 1:26:41.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
E-mail SMS. 

1:26:45.74 --> 1:26:47.34 
John Drum 
Well, you got. Are you looking for the types? 

1:26:45.834 --> 1:26:46.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:26:47.34 --> 1:26:48.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, types, yeah. 

1:26:48.674 --> 1:26:53.394 
John Drum 
Yeah, you got letter, you got, uh, e-mail, you got SMS and you got push. 

1:26:57.874 --> 1:26:59.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, push. Yeah. 

1:27:0.234 --> 1:27:0.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Thanks. 

1:27:24.154 --> 1:27:24.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

1:27:33.874 --> 1:27:41.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
John, we don't need to have this information here, right John? Print policy like default template, default print vendor. 

1:27:34.954 --> 1:27:35.114 
John Drum 
M. 

1:27:43.354 --> 1:27:44.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Add Mahtuk. 

1:27:43.954 --> 1:27:52.74 
John Drum 
I thought you were gonna put the default in the vendor record. I mean, you can put it there too, but then you got to update it in two places. 

1:27:48.714 --> 1:27:49.74 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:27:59.994 --> 1:28:0.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:28:0.994 --> 1:28:17.834 
John Drum 
The reprint policy you still need there because that's that doesn't matter the the print vendor, that's just the print policy. So reprint's fine, but the the default that belongs in the the vendor specific fields or. 

1:28:17.154 --> 1:28:18.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm-hmm. 

1:28:18.154 --> 1:28:18.434 
John Drum 
Table. 

1:28:23.594 --> 1:28:25.834 
John Drum 
Your cooldown is fine there. 

1:28:29.314 --> 1:28:36.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I think that the which one is primary is the default, right? That should be implicit. 

1:28:36.994 --> 1:28:44.314 
John Drum 
Whatever field you define, as long as you got it so that everybody knows what it is in your data dictionary. 

1:28:39.154 --> 1:28:39.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:28:42.514 --> 1:28:43.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:28:45.514 --> 1:28:45.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

1:28:48.674 --> 1:28:54.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That should be, yeah, yeah, primary flag should be the default vendor. 

1:28:54.874 --> 1:29:0.994 
John Drum 
It needs to be not just the vendor. It needs uh. 

1:29:9.74 --> 1:29:11.754 
John Drum 
Uh, 'cause we have different ones. 

1:29:15.594 --> 1:29:18.74 
John Drum 
It needs to be the vendor and version. 

1:29:21.474 --> 1:29:23.794 
John Drum 
Let me think about that. 

1:29:33.954 --> 1:29:43.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, that could be a the old, old, yeah, old version can go to Sentis. The new version goes to Smartcom. 

1:29:36.914 --> 1:29:38.674 
John Drum 
That's a that's a problem. 

1:29:45.194 --> 1:29:48.914 
John Drum 
No, that would be a different print vendor. Uh. 

1:29:50.434 --> 1:29:52.394 
John Drum 
I I hmm. 

1:29:53.874 --> 1:30:6.74 
John Drum 
Because I'm if we have multiple versions that are active at any given time, when they do the default, the default just goes by the the master template and the vendor. 

1:30:8.754 --> 1:30:9.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:30:8.794 --> 1:30:10.954 
John Drum 
Not necessarily a version. 

1:30:12.874 --> 1:30:18.554 
John Drum 
At least I don't want it to go by the version, but versions can actually have different things on it. 

1:30:14.314 --> 1:30:14.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:30:20.474 --> 1:30:21.114 
John Drum 
So. 

1:30:23.794 --> 1:30:25.234 
John Drum 
I'm thinking. 

1:30:27.954 --> 1:30:37.594 
John Drum 
We're gonna have to get rid of we're we're not gonna be able to allow to have multiple versions on the vendor active at any given time because we need to support the default so. 

1:30:39.874 --> 1:30:46.74 
John Drum 
If they want to create three different versions, they're going to have to create three different master templates, different footers. 

1:30:47.474 --> 1:31:2.714 
John Drum 
That's the only other way to do it. So forget what I was saying earlier about having multiple vendors active for different versions. There's only gonna be for a given vendor. There can only be one version that's active. 

1:31:11.714 --> 1:31:13.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, come again, John again. 

1:31:14.114 --> 1:31:30.714 
John Drum 
So before I I had mentioned that we could have different versions of the same vendor active, right? But that doesn't allow us to pick which one is default and you know the customer is not going to know which one is. The guy mentioned that they may have different footers, right? 

1:31:15.794 --> 1:31:16.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:31:18.594 --> 1:31:18.954 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:31:20.914 --> 1:31:21.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:31:32.554 --> 1:31:32.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:31:33.234 --> 1:31:49.74 
John Drum 
Well, those actually have different functionalities. So I I'm when I'm thinking about this, that doesn't make sense for that to be different versions from the vendor. It should actually be different master templates that indicate that the footer is different. So at that point. 

1:31:49.554 --> 1:32:5.554 
John Drum 
There's no reason for any given vendor record on a master template. There should only be one of them that's active. Even if there's different versions, it may not be the highest version that's active, but there can only be one of them that's active, right? 

1:32:5.594 --> 1:32:20.994 
John Drum 
So for a given, for a given vendor, there can only be one active record and then the one of those vendors has to be the default. So then it'll just be the default vendor and then. 

1:32:21.594 --> 1:32:24.674 
John Drum 
the active version for that vendor. 

1:32:27.794 --> 1:32:29.434 
John Drum 
And that could all be done in the vendor might be. 

1:32:32.274 --> 1:32:35.354 
John Drum 
But that you have an active flag on the vendor mapping. 

1:32:37.474 --> 1:32:38.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
When I'm updating, yes. 

1:32:41.634 --> 1:32:49.114 
John Drum 
So that can only be only one of those can be like if there's three different versions, only one of those can be active at any given time. 

1:32:56.994 --> 1:32:57.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

1:32:58.674 --> 1:33:7.234 
John Drum 
So you could have your primary flag set and the active flag set for the the version that's basically active at that time. 

1:33:16.914 --> 1:33:23.874 
John Drum 
And then other vendors can have an active flag, but their primary flag should never be set because they're not the default. 

1:33:24.834 --> 1:33:25.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:33:28.914 --> 1:33:36.114 
John Drum 
And then we'll just say if you change anything, even footers or headers or whatever has to be a new master template record. 

1:33:42.34 --> 1:33:43.634 
John Drum 
That'll keep it simple. 

1:33:44.714 --> 1:33:47.274 
John Drum 
I was hoping to be, yeah. 

1:33:44.994 --> 1:33:50.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Master template. OK, so that that would generate a new master templated. 

1:33:49.154 --> 1:33:58.514 
John Drum 
Let's say they want to change the footer on a record, right? They're going to have to create a new master record, not a new master record version, a new master template. 

1:33:52.74 --> 1:33:52.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh. 

1:33:59.714 --> 1:34:0.274 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

1:34:0.634 --> 1:34:16.914 
John Drum 
If they want to be able to use both, let's say they want to have DCS 153, right? But they have two versions of it, one with the one footer and a different footer on a different one. Those are going to have to be different templates. 

1:34:7.514 --> 1:34:7.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh huh. 

1:34:13.914 --> 1:34:14.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:34:22.874 --> 1:34:37.194 
John Drum 
Not different versions of D153, they need to be like D53 under score version 1D53 under score version two and then in our records you would have version one of both of those. 

1:34:38.954 --> 1:34:44.194 
John Drum 
Because the content of those are actually different. They're different templates. 

1:34:49.234 --> 1:34:49.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:34:54.234 --> 1:34:55.354 
John Drum 
You following what I'm saying? 

1:34:56.234 --> 1:34:58.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, with the template the. 

1:34:56.714 --> 1:34:59.634 
John Drum 
Silence makes me think you guys are confused. 

1:34:58.954 --> 1:35:4.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I think, yeah, following a little bit, but yeah, so just trying to observe this thing. 

1:35:4.74 --> 1:35:16.394 
John Drum 
Just do it. Just forget what I said earlier about using the version numbers to have different content. Anytime they're going to have different content, they're going to have to make a new version, excuse me, a new template. 

1:35:14.954 --> 1:35:15.154 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
3. 

1:35:18.314 --> 1:35:27.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK, so that template type would be different, right? For example, for example SV0019 have under score version one, version 2, so on. 

1:35:27.154 --> 1:35:43.754 
John Drum 
Yes, if they want to have multiple SV0019 letters with different content, let's say that they let's say that this is a vendor specific letter and they have two different vendors. So they would have SV0019 under score vendor name. 

1:35:32.114 --> 1:35:32.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:35:37.34 --> 1:35:38.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:35:44.714 --> 1:35:45.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:35:45.834 --> 1:35:53.554 
John Drum 
For one and then a different vendor name for the other. So it's two different templates and then they may have version one or two or three, whatever underneath each one of those. 

1:35:49.754 --> 1:35:50.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:35:55.474 --> 1:35:57.194 
John Drum 
And that way it keeps it simple. 

1:36:7.634 --> 1:36:8.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
1232. 

1:36:19.514 --> 1:36:19.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh. 

1:36:19.514 --> 1:36:22.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Not thoroughly, but. 

1:36:23.34 --> 1:36:25.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Need to go through this regarding again. 

1:36:26.314 --> 1:36:28.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
Yeah, I I think I'm getting. 

1:36:29.234 --> 1:36:29.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Oh. 

1:36:33.514 --> 1:36:45.874 
John Drum 
Yeah, only basically what I'm saying is we're going to force the back office because it's only going to happen for back office, right? We're going to force them to create a brand new template anytime. 

1:36:40.194 --> 1:36:40.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
H. 

1:36:47.274 --> 1:36:55.474 
John Drum 
They have different information that they're going to send out on the letter, so they may have a letter that they call SB0019. 

1:36:57.194 --> 1:37:4.594 
John Drum 
But if if there's going to be different content on it other than just the drop downs and stuff they pick. 

1:37:5.634 --> 1:37:9.354 
John Drum 
They need to create a new template, not just a new version. 

1:37:18.914 --> 1:37:21.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
But it's not something that we can force, right? It's just. 

1:37:22.114 --> 1:37:29.954 
John Drum 
Yeah, we can force it because if we only allow one to be active at a time, then it's it forces, it enforces itself. 

1:37:23.314 --> 1:37:25.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Uh, I'm thinking of a problem. 

1:37:29.914 --> 1:37:44.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
I'm thinking of a problem John here. Like Yep, so they are trying to. We have placed unicorn line of business template type and what is that version template version. 

1:37:30.514 --> 1:37:30.994 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
OK. 

1:37:32.994 --> 1:37:33.394 
John Drum 
What's that? 

1:37:45.514 --> 1:37:45.754 
John Drum 
Uhuh. 

1:37:45.994 --> 1:38:0.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So when the when the document inquiry is querying for a particular electronic disclosure site, so they need to they would look at the template type as a unique identifier, right? 

1:37:47.194 --> 1:37:47.394 
John Drum 
Yep. 

1:37:55.114 --> 1:37:55.274 
John Drum 
Uh huh. 

1:38:3.474 --> 1:38:3.594 
John Drum 
OK. 

1:38:5.34 --> 1:38:16.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So when they're querying that, do we just name it as SV? But like you said that SV0019 under score V1 would be a new entry template type. 

1:38:19.874 --> 1:38:22.714 
John Drum 
I'm not sure what you're saying. Are you? 

1:38:21.754 --> 1:38:30.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So so template type is SV 0019 under score V1 for each one of them. So any new version in here would require. 

1:38:30.234 --> 1:38:46.34 
John Drum 
No, I that was just an example. Typically there won't be a version number in there. The only reason you would have anything else after it is if they want to use that first part of the name to be the same, but they have a be in different purposes. 

1:38:33.594 --> 1:38:34.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:38:40.34 --> 1:38:40.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:38:47.114 --> 1:38:47.634 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:38:47.354 --> 1:38:54.594 
John Drum 
Then they could use an under score to give it the first part of the categorization the same and then after the under score the specific item. 

1:38:55.874 --> 1:38:58.794 
John Drum 
I don't want him to use the version number to pick. 

1:39:0.74 --> 1:39:13.234 
John Drum 
The use case for the letter. So and 9999% of the time it won't happen. It'll always be. They just got SB0019 and that's the letter. 

1:39:15.594 --> 1:39:17.914 
John Drum 
Once in a blue moon, they may have. 

1:39:19.194 --> 1:39:33.954 
John Drum 
Let's say SB0019 under score Ford and then SB0019 under score Chevy, right? Because it's the same type of letter, but they have two different vendors they send it to. 

1:39:34.634 --> 1:39:51.114 
John Drum 
Right. Because maybe we're doing branded credit cards for those two companies. So when we're sending out correspondence, it has to be branded to that that company. So then when they create their templates, they they use their letter. 

1:39:39.634 --> 1:39:40.234 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:39:51.634 --> 1:40:11.74 
John Drum 
Prefix SV0019, then the under score and then the vendor after it. That way we don't have to worry about version numbers. So when you were when you go to retrieve this, First off of the retrieve basically the list of all the templates, right? So when that comes back as a template, you'll see two entries. 

1:40:11.354 --> 1:40:21.594 
John Drum 
One for SV0019 under score Ford and one for SV0019 under score Chevy and they could pick either one of those to create their letter from. 

1:40:23.554 --> 1:40:31.794 
John Drum 
But basically they're different letters. They're just used the first part to let them know that this is used for the same thing. 

1:40:35.514 --> 1:40:50.514 
John Drum 
And forget about the version number, because it won't matter. Now when you return the template, that brings up a different thing. Now when you when you get the list of those templates, you don't have to pass the version number to return all the list, right? 

1:40:53.234 --> 1:40:53.594 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm. 

1:40:54.554 --> 1:41:2.994 
John Drum 
Because we're just saying we want templates for this line of business and it should just return all of those with the whichever one's active. 

1:41:6.874 --> 1:41:15.474 
John Drum 
Because you're not gonna be querying it on basically the template type. At that point you're you're just querying on. 

1:41:17.34 --> 1:41:21.234 
John Drum 
uh the line of business, and whether it's a shared document or not. 

1:41:22.314 --> 1:41:24.834 
John Drum 
And then getting the the list back. 

1:41:25.914 --> 1:41:27.234 
John Drum 
So it should still work fine. 

1:41:26.954 --> 1:41:27.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
The. 

1:41:31.514 --> 1:41:46.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
My concern was this John like so for example UI would be need to display types of documents in the UI right? So they will be querying based on particular types, template types, right? We we're going to maintain. 

1:41:46.154 --> 1:41:47.594 
John Drum 
What do you mean by type? 

1:41:47.434 --> 1:41:49.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Template types are like dog types in the UI. 

1:41:51.994 --> 1:41:52.994 
John Drum 
It could be. 

1:41:54.34 --> 1:41:55.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
And that. 

1:41:54.154 --> 1:42:0.674 
John Drum 
They they may be doing all of them, or they may be doing it by a category. They they could have different filter conditions. 

1:42:1.394 --> 1:42:16.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes, so so the how they are right now the inquiry inquiry APIs, they're passing category and under that there is some mappings of document types which we renamed to template types here. 

1:42:17.354 --> 1:42:21.154 
John Drum 
OK, you got that information, so you can still do that. 

1:42:17.714 --> 1:42:18.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
So that. 

1:42:21.474 --> 1:42:38.754 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, so if you keep on adding this here like we are like template types, you're adding new, adding new types of templates, then how how would they come to know which templates to pick up on the UI? 

1:42:37.674 --> 1:42:46.794 
John Drum 
Well, they still have the category, right? So you still filter by the category and then it's just going to list those. Then they pick the one from the list. 

1:42:43.754 --> 1:42:43.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
M. 

1:42:49.354 --> 1:42:59.434 
John Drum 
Now are you asking how do they know SV0019 is like a disclosure letter or not disclosure, but they should know that because they created the template right? 

1:42:54.714 --> 1:42:55.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:43:0.74 --> 1:43:0.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:43:3.714 --> 1:43:3.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
OK. 

1:43:4.154 --> 1:43:13.554 
John Drum 
And if we have to be some other master document that's not in here that says SV00, isn't there a description? I thought we had a template description somewhere. 

1:43:15.234 --> 1:43:15.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:43:16.314 --> 1:43:20.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Template description which is a the column descriptions. 

1:43:20.314 --> 1:43:21.474 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
It's about the template category. 

1:43:28.794 --> 1:43:30.34 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
You miss. 

1:43:33.634 --> 1:43:37.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah, we have. We have this description, yeah. 

1:43:39.794 --> 1:43:46.594 
John Drum 
So yeah, you can just have it. If they hover over it, maybe that's a tool tip on it, you know, gives you a description of the. 

1:43:47.714 --> 1:43:49.434 
John Drum 
Individual template name. 

1:44:0.834 --> 1:44:2.514 
John Drum 
I think it still works. 

1:44:20.74 --> 1:44:28.834 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Takes time to absorb this information, John. Think about it. It will take some time to absorb this information and think about it. 

1:44:23.394 --> 1:44:23.874 
John Drum 
What's that? 

1:44:27.714 --> 1:44:32.594 
John Drum 
Oh yeah, there's a lot of stuff there. I've been thinking about it for a year, so you guys are just catching up. 

1:44:31.994 --> 1:44:40.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First thing off, like, like, you just need to sort out the. 

1:44:34.434 --> 1:44:34.794 
Jagadeesh Chitta 
It. 

1:44:43.514 --> 1:44:54.514 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Start date and active date flags, then add it types of templates like letter emails, SMS, push then this versioning. 

1:44:56.514 --> 1:44:56.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Art. 

1:44:57.394 --> 1:45:16.34 
John Drum 
Yeah, I what I would do if I were you and I would sit there and, you know, write down the different scenarios for back office versus just our API, the system API and say, OK, if I'm doing these things, what parameters am I going to see on my screen? What am I going to be able to pick? 

1:45:0.234 --> 1:45:0.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
8. 

1:45:8.274 --> 1:45:8.994 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:45:16.234 --> 1:45:32.834 
John Drum 
And then make sure that everything supports that, because that's how I think of it. I I'm sitting here, if I'm a back office person and I got my GUI in front of me, you know, I got some scenarios that I'm doing. I have to be able to pick a template and I need to be able to query a an account. 

1:45:19.794 --> 1:45:20.314 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:45:25.394 --> 1:45:25.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:45:33.434 --> 1:45:41.874 
John Drum 
To initially populate my data model so that when it shows in my draft editor, some of those fields are pre-populated, right? 

1:45:41.554 --> 1:45:42.394 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:45:43.34 --> 1:45:55.194 
John Drum 
You know, so how do I make all that happen? And then understanding that everything I'm doing has to be completely configurable. When I add new stuff, I don't want to have to go in and make code changes. 

1:45:55.994 --> 1:46:2.874 
John Drum 
Because at some point what you really want to be able to do is say, OK, if I want to wrap this up and make it a product and sell it to somebody like FICO. 

1:46:3.634 --> 1:46:16.754 
John Drum 
You know, I don't want to have to make code changes to do that to a different person. Yeah, I just want to be able to come in and have a, you know, documented how all the configuration works and then another company could use the product that you developed. 

1:46:6.874 --> 1:46:7.674 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:46:17.634 --> 1:46:17.874 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
M. 

1:46:19.434 --> 1:46:35.794 
John Drum 
That's why I go out of the way, you know, to do everything configurable the way I do, so that in the future you just support, you know, bug fixes, not enhance functionality, because to enhance functionality. 

1:46:36.154 --> 1:46:38.594 
John Drum 
You just go in and add new configuration stuff. 

1:46:40.114 --> 1:46:40.554 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm. 

1:46:43.114 --> 1:46:49.474 
John Drum 
Because based on all this too, we can add new templates to the document area of the website. 

1:46:52.74 --> 1:46:52.754 
John Drum 
You know. 

1:46:53.314 --> 1:46:53.794 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:46:56.154 --> 1:46:56.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yep. 

1:46:59.594 --> 1:47:3.674 
John Drum 
I think there's a field in there that says whether it's displayed in the web, right? 

1:47:4.714 --> 1:47:5.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:47:6.154 --> 1:47:6.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:47:14.314 --> 1:47:22.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I I think I'll, I'll go through this recording again and see what's we need to do and implement those changes and then. 

1:47:24.74 --> 1:47:30.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
We'll come back tomorrow. Yep. It's time to think and yeah. 

1:47:29.34 --> 1:47:36.434 
John Drum 
But yeah, this is the most complex piece of the document hub, so everything is based on this. We need to make sure it's right. 

1:47:42.994 --> 1:47:50.914 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, Yep, Yep, Yep. It's getting much, much, much more complex. Yeah. 

1:47:47.194 --> 1:47:48.994 
John Drum 
That's why they pay the big bucks, man. 

1:47:51.994 --> 1:47:52.354 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:47:54.634 --> 1:47:57.914 
John Drum 
Now you see why the data dictionary is so important for this stuff. 

1:47:57.994 --> 1:47:58.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mm. 

1:48:2.754 --> 1:48:5.754 
John Drum 
Sometimes these names are a little vague on what they actually do. 

1:48:12.714 --> 1:48:28.914 
John Drum 
Is what we haven't documented yet are the use case scenarios. At some point we need to sit down and do that because QA will need it so that we can, you know, test all the scenarios because we have two scenarios, right? This is used for. 

1:48:12.874 --> 1:48:13.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:48:21.154 --> 1:48:21.474 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah. 

1:48:29.394 --> 1:48:44.154 
John Drum 
Back office generation of letters. It's used for creating new templates through our workflow. It's used for the just the API when we go to send out a letter. 

1:48:30.994 --> 1:48:31.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yes. 

1:48:34.154 --> 1:48:34.434 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
That's. 

1:48:38.474 --> 1:48:39.194 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:48:46.554 --> 1:49:1.594 
John Drum 
Because there's, you know, there's some documents that we don't generate that come from, let's say Fiserv, but they still have to have a master template record, even if they have no vendor template records because nothing. 

1:48:59.634 --> 1:49:0.114 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Mhm. 

1:49:1.634 --> 1:49:5.514 
John Drum 
Gets added into the document hub. It doesn't have a master template. 

1:49:7.874 --> 1:49:8.34 
John Drum 
Right. 

1:49:11.274 --> 1:49:17.274 
John Drum 
It could be added to ECMS, but it doesn't get added to document hub without having a master template record. 

1:49:29.754 --> 1:49:38.714 
Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, let's let's regroup tomorrow, John. Like I'll let me let the team think about this and and do the team. 

1:49:37.74 --> 1:49:42.234 
John Drum 
OK, you got tomorrow and Wednesday. After that I'm on vacation for the new year, so. 

1:49:41.994 --> 1:49:43.634

Taher Ghulam Mohammed 
Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll get something. Yep, get this polished by just Wednesday. 

1:49:53.714 --> 1:49:54.34

Murali Naramamidi 
I. 

1:55:44.874 --> 1:55:57.594 
Satheesh Babu 
Tahir, I think this was they did it manually initial time to get the data through get end point. So through they people are directly uploaded in the ECMS itself. 

1:55:45.34 --> 1:55:45.234 
Murali Naramamidi 
No. 

1:55:58.394 --> 1:55:58.594

Yeah, yeah, yes, yes. Maybe not sure. Tahil, I'm not confident the file name what they mentioned on the storage index and they mentioned in the EC ECMS. So if if it is required.

Murali Naramamidi 
Yes, yes. 

1:56:24.154 --> 1:56:37.634
