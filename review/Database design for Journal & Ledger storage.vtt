00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:50.848
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>On the right side it should be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/53-0
00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:56.008
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>So that was what we, I think, left.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/52-0
00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:54.768

00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:59.376
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Is yeah,
we designed this new what you call ledger</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/54-1
00:02:59.376 --> 00:02:59.768
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>table.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/55-0
00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So we had that would be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/56-0
00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:06.288

00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:08.754
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>It's yeah,
it's slightly different from what we have</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/57-1
00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:12.168
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>currently been using in the wrapper.
There's a few things.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/58-0
00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:16.168

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/59-0
00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:19.728
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>It's the proxy tab, not the platform.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/60-0
00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, proxy, OK.</v>

00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:40.772
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>So there's three more columns.
I think it's missing from here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/65-1
00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:41.448

00:04:57.288 --> 00:05:02.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Not null columns that that means we have
to have a value in this column.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/90-0
00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:09.273
<v John Drum>What doesn't necessarily mean that it
could have a default value that gets put</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/90-1
00:05:09.273 --> 00:05:12.048

00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:20.692
<v John Drum>Like ECMS key,

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/92-1
00:05:20.692 --> 00:05:24.451
<v John Drum>there. It's a UUID.
You don't have anything in here about</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/92-2
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:27.756
<v John Drum>that at all.
So how do I know that that's if not a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/92-3
00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:28.728
<v John Drum>required field?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/93-0
00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:33.288
<v John Drum>Because you said it's empty at the moment,
right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/94-0
00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:35.991
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah,
that will be null value if you don't put</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/94-1
00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:36.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>anything.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/95-0

00:05:38.128 --> 00:05:43.994
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>It would in what you call it,
just keep a null value out there if you</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/97-0
00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:46.848
<v John Drum>OK,
so that means that's not a required field.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/96-1
00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:45.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>don't add any.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/98-0

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:51.690
<v John Drum>OK,
there should be something indicating that</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/99-1
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.928
<v John Drum>because when I look at this I have no
idea if it is or not.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/100-0
00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:56.808
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/101-0
00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:02.934
<v John Drum>So I said we need to start cleaning up
our database definitions and these little</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/101-1
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:06.448
<v John Drum>screenshots that we put in these diagrams.
That's not a proper.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/103-0
00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:15.138
<v John Drum>Database table diagram.
We should have these tables build out in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/102-0
00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.208
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/103-1
00:06:15.138 --> 00:06:15.488
<v John Drum>um.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/105-0
00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:20.488
<v John Drum>And this also.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/106-0
00:06:24.328 --> 00:06:28.199
<v John Drum>You know what I'm saying?
You should have an entity diagram created</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/107-0
00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:31.288
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah, I'll.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/106-1
00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:28.768
<v John Drum>for these.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/109-0
00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:31.825
<v John Drum>Otherwise,
how are we ever gonna do a data</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/109-1
00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:33.685
<v John Drum>dictionary?
Because there needs to be a data</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/109-2
00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.008
<v John Drum>dictionary for all these tables.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/108-0
00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:35.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/110-0
00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:39.343
<v John Drum>Um, anyway,
so let's go with what we got to here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/110-1
00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:43.226
<v John Drum>This is a document journal ID.
Is this the same document journal ID</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/110-2
00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:44.768
<v John Drum>that's in the other tables?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/112-0
00:06:46.328 --> 00:06:47.928
<v John Drum>The one we've seen for the reprint.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/111-0
00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:48.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>And this is the primary good.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/113-0
00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:49.248
<v Prachi Kulkarni>Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/114-0
00:06:50.768 --> 00:06:50.888
<v John Drum>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/115-0
00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:53.808
<v Prachi Kulkarni>Then you see.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/116-0
00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:53.648
<v John Drum>Processor key.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/117-0
00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:57.648
<v John Drum>Who's a processor?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/118-0
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.985
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Downstream service.
So in this case for authentis,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/118-1
00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:06.128
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>it's returning us our reference number.
We're storing it as processor key.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/121-0
00:07:06.608 --> 00:07:12.408
<v John Drum>So it's the consumer, the the renderer,
right? OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/119-0
00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:10.208
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Contumer cracking ID.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/120-0
00:07:11.288 --> 00:07:11.808
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/122-0
00:07:13.608 --> 00:07:19.918
<v John Drum>Description, individual key,
customer identifier, account key,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/122-1
00:07:19.918 --> 00:07:25.528
<v John Drum>account agent.
I take it those are not required fields.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/123-0
00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:31.728
<v John Drum>The main key.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/124-0
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.088
<v John Drum>What's the domain key?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/125-0
00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:41.318
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>So domain key in in case like the
processor description was application.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/125-1
00:07:41.318 --> 00:07:46.699
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>I I mean the if the application type was
application instead of an account then</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/125-2
00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:51.677
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>instead of passing a account ID for
authentis they would be passing us an</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/125-3
00:07:51.677 --> 00:07:52.888
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>application ID so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/126-0
00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:57.902
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>We would use domain key for any other
primary keys or application IDs or</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/128-0
00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:02.358
<v John Drum>So you're you're saying this is like
customer service acquisitions,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/126-1
00:07:57.902 --> 00:07:58.848
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>anything else.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/128-1
00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:08.342
<v John Drum>is that what you're saying the domain is
because the domain is typically not a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/127-0
00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:06.608
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/129-0
00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:11.288
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>No,
it was supposed to be more general like I</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/128-2
00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:10.008
<v John Drum>product you're you're.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/129-1
00:08:11.288 --> 00:08:17.037
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>I I haven't kept it specifically as
domain key to use as an extra column in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/129-2
00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:18.928
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>case anything was needed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/131-0
00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:24.050
<v John Drum>I understand,
but typically a domain is like accounts,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/130-0
00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:24.768
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/131-1
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.648
<v John Drum>right? Or payments.
Is that what's being passed in here?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/132-0
00:08:30.648 --> 00:08:34.771
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Currently it's only being used for
application IDs.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/132-1
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:39.528
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Which application is calling it if they
have a specific ID?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/133-0
00:08:39.848 --> 00:08:45.842
<v John Drum>So you're actually putting the ID in here
or you're putting the the fact that it's</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/133-1
00:08:45.842 --> 00:08:47.648
<v John Drum>from application process?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/134-0
00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:50.048
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>We're putting the IDs in there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/135-0
00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:55.964
<v John Drum>So how do you know which type it is?
How do you know it's an application ID</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/135-1
00:08:55.964 --> 00:08:57.488
<v John Drum>versus a customer ID?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/136-0
00:08:57.848 --> 00:09:03.515
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>We have a field for customer ID and a
separate parameter for accepting customer</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/136-1
00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:03.728
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>ID.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/138-0
00:09:04.408 --> 00:09:09.003
<v John Drum>You're missing my point.
You you have a a key that you're putting</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/137-0
00:09:04.808 --> 00:09:05.928
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>In the request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/138-1
00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:11.928
<v John Drum>in here that you're saying is application.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/139-0
00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:14.928
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/142-0
00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:17.656
<v John Drum>But it could be something else.
If it's something else,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/142-1
00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:18.928
<v John Drum>how do I know what it is?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/140-0
00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:18.848
<v Prachi Kulkarni>That's OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/144-0
00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:24.328
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>If application type column the one below
that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/143-0
00:09:22.448 --> 00:09:23.568
<v Prachi Kulkarni>Right. Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/146-0
00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:30.728
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Right now it's only accounts for
application and accounts so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/145-0
00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:27.328
<v John Drum>Application.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/147-0
00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:36.808
<v John Drum>And what if it's from digital banking?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/148-0
00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:43.728
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>We'll need to update application type and
use the any.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/149-0
00:09:42.968 --> 00:09:44.848
<v John Drum>Wait, is this an Enum?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/150-0
00:09:46.928 --> 00:09:47.168
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/152-0
00:09:48.408 --> 00:09:50.369
<v John Drum>We shouldn't have an enum in there,
remember,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/151-0
00:09:48.848 --> 00:09:49.728
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Oh, it's.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/152-1
00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:52.928
<v John Drum>because I don't want enums for things
that can be added to.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/153-0
00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>It's enforced to Swagger hub right now,
but I don't think the database column is</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/153-1
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.888
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>a, you know, it's a character bearing.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/155-0
00:10:02.848 --> 00:10:08.128
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah, it's enforced through open API spec,
so we can change that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/159-0
00:10:08.168 --> 00:10:10.812
<v John Drum>Yeah,
because they're gonna actually do an</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/159-1
00:10:10.812 --> 00:10:15.423
<v John Drum>audit against the API specs against the
actual stuff and grade us on that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/159-2
00:10:15.423 --> 00:10:18.128
<v John Drum>So we need to make sure everything
matches.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/157-0
00:10:15.808 --> 00:10:15.888
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Uh.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/160-0
00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:22.848
<v John Drum>The data.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/163-0
00:10:36.088 --> 00:10:40.488
<v John Drum>So OK, so metadata in this case has more.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/164-0
00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:44.048
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Entirety of the payload request payload.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/165-0
00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:46.968
<v John Drum>OK, status.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/167-0
00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:55.728
<v John Drum>This is the OK,
this is the actual table created by.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/168-0
00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:05.208
<v John Drum>So isn't this this is a Ledger table or
is this a regular table?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/169-0
00:11:06.368 --> 00:11:10.528
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Not a Ledger table.
We updated the status in the same column.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/170-0
00:11:11.248 --> 00:11:11.368
<v John Drum>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/172-0
00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:17.368
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>So it's a audit, audit log, audit table.
That's what we were calling it previously.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/173-0
00:11:17.888 --> 00:11:18.208
<v John Drum>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/174-0
00:11:29.448 --> 00:11:32.968
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So what are these three columns?
Document request number?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/175-0
00:11:31.888 --> 00:11:38.155
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah, those were recently added new ones.
There's one more for actor type as well.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/175-1
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:39.968
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>I'm just adding it here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/176-0
00:11:45.168 --> 00:11:48.008
<v John Drum>Template code. What is that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/178-0
00:11:48.928 --> 00:11:53.009
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Oh, the letter template code.
In this case it would be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/177-0
00:11:51.008 --> 00:11:53.568
<v John Drum>We didn't have that in there already.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/178-1
00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:57.528
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>It wasn't there previously,
so we added it a few months back.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/179-0
00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:01.968
<v John Drum>But it wasn't there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/181-0
00:12:01.128 --> 00:12:05.119
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yes, previously it wasn't there.
We would need to check in the metadata,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/181-1
00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:07.088
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>so we we wanted to get the template.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/180-0
00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:07.048
<v John Drum>Mm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/183-0
00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.088
<v John Drum>Why is our card left for?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/182-0
00:12:09.168 --> 00:12:09.768
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Insight.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/184-0
00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:15.806
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>That was I think SA needed the card last
four to be displayed for the UCRM</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/184-1
00:12:15.806 --> 00:12:19.842
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>requirement for their UI.
They were displaying the card last four,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/184-2
00:12:19.842 --> 00:12:24.601
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>so we needed a column specifically for
this and we that's why we were fetching</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/184-3
00:12:24.601 --> 00:12:26.288
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>it at the very beginning of.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/185-0
00:12:26.728 --> 00:12:29.088
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Any process if.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/186-0
00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:29.439
<v John Drum>Yeah,
I wish you to talk to me about that</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/186-1
00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:31.008
<v John Drum>because that doesn't belong in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/187-0
00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:33.008
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Right.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/190-0
00:12:34.008 --> 00:12:39.199
<v John Drum>If they need to know the card last four,
they should go query it for that account.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/188-0
00:12:34.168 --> 00:12:36.208
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>But yeah, UCRMCUI.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/189-0
00:12:38.808 --> 00:12:39.448
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/190-1
00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:40.888
<v John Drum>It's not part of the print.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/191-0
00:12:42.848 --> 00:12:49.008
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah, UCRM's UI is using it and like,
I think that, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/192-0
00:12:47.848 --> 00:12:50.824
<v John Drum>I don't care.
It still doesn't belong there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/192-1
00:12:50.824 --> 00:12:53.998
<v John Drum>If they need it,
then there should have been an</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/192-2
00:12:53.998 --> 00:12:59.288
<v John Drum>orchestration API that when they pull the
data, goes out and joins the account.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/194-0
00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:04.195
<v John Drum>to that information before it returns it
to there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/194-1
00:13:04.195 --> 00:13:09.768
<v John Drum>That's what their whole BFF layers for.
It doesn't belong in the print.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/193-0
00:13:04.968 --> 00:13:05.768
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/195-0
00:13:10.768 --> 00:13:12.688
<v John Drum>Is actor type? What is that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/197-0
00:13:13.848 --> 00:13:18.615
<v John Drum>Because there can be letters and stuff in
here that we print that have no card</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/196-0
00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:15.608
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>It's a.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/197-1
00:13:18.615 --> 00:13:20.848
<v John Drum>number can be lots of correspondence.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/198-0
00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:23.186
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Right. For that we keep a -,
1 default value through the process,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/198-1
00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:27.368
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>not through the database,
but through the business logic right now.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/200-0
00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:29.295
<v John Drum>We need to get, yeah,
that doesn't belong in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/200-1
00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:32.928
<v John Drum>That needs to come out and that needs to
be done through the API.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/199-0
00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:30.128
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/201-0
00:13:36.408 --> 00:13:40.528
<v John Drum>Actor type. That's right about OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/202-0
00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:46.688
<v John Drum>Where's the Ledger database definition?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/203-0
00:13:47.168 --> 00:13:47.408
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/204-0
00:13:53.648 --> 00:13:54.448
<v John Drum>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/205-0
00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:14.368
<v John Drum>Why is there two of the? Oh, this is.
What is the one on the right represent?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/207-0
00:14:13.928 --> 00:14:21.063
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>This is the description I've added like
before we got to just the description.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/207-1
00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:25.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>This is the what we call. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/206-0
00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:24.808
<v John Drum>Call for the fields on the left.
That's the description on the right.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/212-0
00:14:48.088 --> 00:14:50.128
<v John Drum>So for this Ledger, there's missing stuff.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/214-0
00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:57.328
<v John Drum>So remember on any Ledger there should be
a a column that says the entry type is.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/215-0
00:15:02.608 --> 00:15:04.928
<v John Drum>Remember we talked about that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/216-0
00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:08.728
<v John Drum>Uh.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/218-0
00:15:20.768 --> 00:15:21.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Enter it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/219-0
00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:24.312
<v John Drum>So this Ledger should be the same.
You know,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/219-1
00:15:24.312 --> 00:15:27.665
<v John Drum>I don't want to have a dozen different
ledgers.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/219-2
00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:31.648
<v John Drum>There should be 1 Ledger or whether it's
print, reprint.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/221-0
00:15:32.968 --> 00:15:38.089
<v John Drum>Document hub retrieval, whatever.
So there needs to be 1 Ledger table and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/220-0
00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:37.568
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/221-1
00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:41.480
<v John Drum>then different columns added to
distinguish. OK,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/221-2
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.533
<v John Drum>what wrote the Ledger entry? You know,
did it come from a print request?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/221-3
00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:52.208
<v John Drum>Did it come from a document hub request?
Did it come from a read or send request?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/222-0
00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:59.631
<v John Drum>And there should be a a column that
defines what type of for that given row</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/222-1
00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:06.137
<v John Drum>in the Ledger, what is it? In other words,
is this the initial entry?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/222-2
00:16:06.137 --> 00:16:08.368
<v John Drum>Is this a status change?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/223-0
00:16:08.808 --> 00:16:13.358
<v John Drum>Is this, you know, a final entry there?
I don't know off the top of my head.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/223-1
00:16:13.358 --> 00:16:16.785
<v John Drum>I don't have all the different types that
would be there,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/223-2
00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:21.571
<v John Drum>but because if I come into this Ledger
and I want to see the original entry that</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/223-3
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:24.408
<v John Drum>has all the payloads,
because this should have.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/224-0
00:16:24.408 --> 00:16:30.088
<v John Drum>That a record in it that has the payload
from the other record also, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/225-0
00:16:33.128 --> 00:16:33.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Hmm, Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/226-0
00:16:33.768 --> 00:16:35.688
<v John Drum>The answer is yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/227-0
00:16:37.608 --> 00:16:42.225
<v John Drum>So that's the initial entry record and if
I want to go in there and query that,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/227-1
00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:45.861
<v John Drum>I should build a filter on the this
Ledger row type, you know,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/227-2
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:49.554
<v John Drum>for whatever we call it,
let's say it's the initial entry and I</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/227-3
00:16:49.554 --> 00:16:53.248
<v John Drum>should be able to just filter on that and
then not see all the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/228-0
00:16:53.648 --> 00:16:58.700
<v John Drum>Update ledger entries after that or I
should be able to just go filter and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/228-1
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.608
<v John Drum>retrieve all the ledger entries for a
given rint request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/229-0
00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:07.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>The initial entry would contain the
request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/234-0
00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:13.640
<v John Drum>Of course this this Ledger has everything
that happens to this request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/230-0
00:17:10.048 --> 00:17:10.528
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/234-1
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.937
<v John Drum>So you have a table on the left here.
That's not the Ledger,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/234-2
00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:22.164
<v John Drum>but the other table we just looked at.
It's a status table.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/231-0
00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:19.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/232-0
00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:20.768
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Uh huh.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/234-3
00:17:22.164 --> 00:17:25.968
<v John Drum>It gets updated and stuff,
but the Ledger everything.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/233-0
00:17:22.848 --> 00:17:23.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/235-0
00:17:26.248 --> 00:17:30.705
<v John Drum>That happens should have a Ledger entry,
because all you're doing is added entries</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/235-1
00:17:30.705 --> 00:17:33.819
<v John Drum>to this. You don't have to search, find,
update anything.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/235-2
00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:36.772
<v John Drum>You're adding a new role every time
something happens,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/235-3
00:17:36.772 --> 00:17:40.048
<v John Drum>and that's happening for the entire life
cycle of something.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/235-4
00:17:40.048 --> 00:17:44.021
<v John Drum>So the first time it's created,
it gets put in here when it gets added to</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/235-5
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:46.008
<v John Drum>when the producer creates topic item.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/236-0
00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:50.834
<v John Drum>It gets added in here when the you know
we should be able to trace the the life</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/236-1
00:17:50.834 --> 00:17:55.306
<v John Drum>cycle of this print request all the way
through the system until the end by</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/236-2
00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:59.954
<v John Drum>seeing journal entry Ledger entries in
here where on the other one all you see</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/236-3
00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.248
<v John Drum>is the current status.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/237-0
00:18:01.728 --> 00:18:06.507
<v John Drum>You don't see what happened to get to
that status. To see that whole path,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/237-1
00:18:06.507 --> 00:18:11.223
<v John Drum>you look in the Ledger, you know,
cause it'll show the current entry when</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/237-2
00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:15.621
<v John Drum>it went through the producer,
when it got picked up by the consumer,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/237-3
00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:20.528
<v John Drum>you know when it got saved in the
document hub, when it got pulled from the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/238-0
00:18:21.808 --> 00:18:26.781
<v John Drum>Delivery hub, you know,
when it got sent out the door for HOV</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/238-1
00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:31.513
<v John Drum>versus Broadridge,
all of those things has a journal entry</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/238-2
00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:37.448
<v John Drum>and there should be an identifier to say,
OK, what type of entry is this?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/239-0
00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:44.038
<v John Drum>Where did it come from? You know?
So not every column in that that Ledger</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/239-1
00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:49.547
<v John Drum>will be there every time,
but there'll be a row for every time</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/239-2
00:18:49.547 --> 00:18:51.208
<v John Drum>something happened.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/240-0
00:18:52.848 --> 00:18:56.366
<v John Drum>And then we can filter on the grouping of
those ledgers,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/240-1
00:18:56.366 --> 00:19:00.686
<v John Drum>because there's also has to be some kind
of identifier that says, OK,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/240-2
00:19:00.686 --> 00:19:04.018
<v John Drum>these are all the ledger entries for a
given request,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/240-3
00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:07.968
<v John Drum>whether it be a print request or a a
reprint request, you know.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/241-0
00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:14.014
<v John Drum>So that you can just go back and say, OK,
give me all the Ledger entries for this</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/241-1
00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:17.042
<v John Drum>reprint. Oh,
I see this got put into Kafka topic,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/241-2
00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:21.644
<v John Drum>but nothing has ever picked it up yet.
So you can trace the history of what</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/241-3
00:19:21.644 --> 00:19:25.763
<v John Drum>happened at that request in there.
And currently there's not enough</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/241-4
00:19:25.763 --> 00:19:28.488
<v John Drum>information in this Ledger table to do
that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/243-0
00:19:28.728 --> 00:19:35.225
<v John Drum>At you have event origin service.
I take it that's what says where it came</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/243-1
00:19:35.225 --> 00:19:39.990
<v John Drum>from. Maybe event status. OK,
that's request received,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/242-0
00:19:35.688 --> 00:19:37.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm-hmm. Yes. Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/243-2
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.408
<v John Drum>document generated. OK,
that could be used to put.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/244-0
00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:49.710
<v John Drum>The types in there,
although I prefer it to be a number</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/244-1
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.088
<v John Drum>instead of text.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/245-0
00:19:52.488 --> 00:19:54.848
<v John Drum>Template type uh but.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/246-0
00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:58.944
<v John Drum>Vendor,
they're they're just missing things in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/246-1
00:19:58.944 --> 00:20:01.984
<v John Drum>here because if you go back and look in
this Ledger,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/246-2
00:20:01.984 --> 00:20:05.368
<v John Drum>it should have everything in it to
reproduce that request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/247-0
00:20:06.328 --> 00:20:08.653
<v John Drum>And it's currently missing that
information.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/247-1
00:20:08.653 --> 00:20:11.288
<v John Drum>You would have to go to the other table
to get it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/248-0
00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:12.768
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/249-0
00:20:13.408 --> 00:20:16.939
<v John Drum>But the ledger's a stand alone entity.
You should have everything from the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/249-1
00:20:16.939 --> 00:20:17.928
<v John Drum>beginning to the end.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/250-0
00:20:18.928 --> 00:20:22.333
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>A quick question, John,
where do you want to store the request</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/250-1
00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:24.766
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>payload? So that metadata Jason BLOB,
right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/250-2
00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:28.928
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>That's where we're storing the request.
Do you want it in the Ledger or the?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/253-0
00:20:27.168 --> 00:20:31.571
<v John Drum>Well, if it doesn't have it in there,
there needs to be one because it's just</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/253-1
00:20:31.571 --> 00:20:35.748
<v John Drum>it's going to be a Jason object.
So it could if that's what's going to go</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/251-0
00:20:33.968 --> 00:20:35.288
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Alright, alright.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/253-2
00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:38.740
<v John Drum>into metadata,
then that's fine because the metadata</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/254-0
00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:41.435
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Right, it's in the, it's in the audit log,
right? But if you put it in the ledger,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/253-3
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.248
<v John Drum>could be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/254-1
00:20:41.435 --> 00:20:43.208
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>there's gonna be duplicate, so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/257-0
00:20:42.448 --> 00:20:45.817
<v John Drum>Well, well, yes,
there's going to be a duplicate there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/257-1
00:20:45.817 --> 00:20:50.088
<v John Drum>That's fine. That's all right.
There is a metadata in the Ledger here,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/257-2
00:20:50.088 --> 00:20:55.141
<v John Drum>but the metadata is going to be different
depending upon the type and the source of</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/257-3
00:20:55.141 --> 00:20:57.968
<v John Drum>the Ledger entry,
right for a reprint request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/256-0
00:20:57.808 --> 00:20:58.608
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Mm-hmm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/259-0
00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:03.112
<v John Drum>It will look different than a print
request because the reprint request and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/259-1
00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:06.008
<v John Drum>the metadata could have an extra address
in it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/258-0
00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:07.648
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>M.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/260-0
00:21:08.128 --> 00:21:12.943
<v John Drum>The print request may or may not,
so even for the same letter,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/260-1
00:21:12.943 --> 00:21:18.598
<v John Drum>a reprint metadata is going to be
different and it won't have an entry in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/260-2
00:21:18.598 --> 00:21:21.961
<v John Drum>the document journal ledger. No,
excuse me,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/260-3
00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:26.088
<v John Drum>it won't have a a reprint won't have an
entry in the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/261-0
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.928
<v John Drum>Rent table that we were looking at
earlier.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/263-0
00:21:31.288 --> 00:21:33.808
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Currently it does about.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/262-0
00:21:32.568 --> 00:21:32.928
<v John Drum>Because.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/264-0
00:21:33.808 --> 00:21:36.290
<v John Drum>Why? It's not a print request.
It's a the print.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/264-1
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.786
<v John Drum>It's already been generated.
The print table was only for generation</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/264-2
00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:40.648
<v John Drum>of new documents.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/266-0
00:21:42.128 --> 00:21:45.448
<v John Drum>It would have a Ledger entry,
but it shouldn't have a.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/265-0
00:21:42.888 --> 00:21:43.048
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Right.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/267-0
00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:49.977
<v John Drum>Rendering table entry because it's
already been rendered.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/267-1
00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:53.816
<v John Drum>All's we're doing is resending it to the
customer so that there would be a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/267-2
00:21:53.816 --> 00:21:57.348
<v John Drum>document journal Ledger entry,
but there's not going to be the other</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/267-3
00:21:57.348 --> 00:22:01.187
<v John Drum>table that shows the status of a print
request because you're not printing</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/267-4
00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:01.648
<v John Drum>anything.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/269-0
00:22:02.288 --> 00:22:05.550
<v John Drum>And when I say print,
I'm talking about rendering the PDF</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/268-0
00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:07.888
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>OK. OK. OK. Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/269-1
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.488
<v John Drum>because it's already been rendered,
not actual printing of the paper.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/271-0
00:22:10.768 --> 00:22:16.753
<v John Drum>We got to be careful not to confuse when
we say print because the first table that</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/271-1
00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:20.646
<v John Drum>we enters into the system simply renders
the the PDF.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/271-2
00:22:20.646 --> 00:22:26.415
<v John Drum>It doesn't actually print anything and
that has its own table with statuses and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/270-0
00:22:24.608 --> 00:22:25.928
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/271-3
00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:27.208
<v John Drum>everything.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/272-0
00:22:27.648 --> 00:22:32.533
<v John Drum>But this document Ledger is shared
between the rendering, the resending,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/272-1
00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:36.950
<v John Drum>all those different systems.
So that's why it has a source to say</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/272-2
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.702
<v John Drum>where this entry's coming from,
and then the metadata is going to look</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/272-3
00:22:41.702 --> 00:22:45.048
<v John Drum>different depending upon those different
sources.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/273-0
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:51.951
<v John Drum>And that's one table that we can see all
the communications that is happening from</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/273-1
00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:56.025
<v John Drum>all these different systems.
Otherwise you have to go to the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/273-2
00:22:56.025 --> 00:23:00.900
<v John Drum>individual system like you know,
the document rendering part and look in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/273-3
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.768
<v John Drum>those tables.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/274-0
00:23:02.328 --> 00:23:07.511
<v John Drum>And then go to the document hub and look
at its tables and then go to the delivery</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/274-1
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:11.321
<v John Drum>hub and look at its tables.
There there's you got a bunch of</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/274-2
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:16.317
<v John Drum>disparate systems with different statuses,
whereas the document journal Ledger,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/274-3
00:23:16.317 --> 00:23:19.128
<v John Drum>it has the entries for all of those
systems.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/275-0
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:25.185
<v John Drum>So you can you can easily come in here
and query and see you know what the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/275-1
00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:31.313
<v John Drum>initial entry points were and see that OK,
this was initial initial entry from the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/275-2
00:23:31.313 --> 00:23:35.448
<v John Drum>delivery hub,
so we know that is a resend or a reprint.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/276-0
00:23:36.048 --> 00:23:37.448
<v John Drum>And uh.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/277-0
00:23:40.928 --> 00:23:45.894
<v John Drum>An initial request to render the PDF and
then from there it went to the document</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/277-1
00:23:45.894 --> 00:23:50.798
<v John Drum>hub to be saved and then from there it
went to the delivery hub to be delivered</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/277-2
00:23:50.798 --> 00:23:53.128
<v John Drum>and it got printed and it went to HOV.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/278-0
00:23:54.368 --> 00:23:55.808
<v John Drum>And you can see that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/279-0
00:23:56.688 --> 00:23:59.755
<v John Drum>All from the document journal Ledger.
You're you're not.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/279-1
00:23:59.755 --> 00:24:03.844
<v John Drum>You're only going to see parts of that
from the individual table. Like you,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/279-2
00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:08.041
<v John Drum>you might see who the print vendor was
done and you might say it was printed,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/279-3
00:24:08.041 --> 00:24:11.807
<v John Drum>but you don't know all the steps that
happened along the path, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/279-4
00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:13.368
<v John Drum>That comes from this journal.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/281-0
00:24:13.808 --> 00:24:20.974
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Right, yes. So for the reprint one,
currently in the wrapper we are storing</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/280-0
00:24:16.128 --> 00:24:19.808
<v John Drum>That makes sense what I'm describing?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/281-1
00:24:20.974 --> 00:24:28.139
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>the reprint request as well for our
statement and disclosures and that same</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/281-2
00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:33.608
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>that same request payload is being
retried again by UCRM.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/282-0
00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:36.648
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>For the requirement for that front end UI
of theirs.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/284-0
00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:40.610
<v John Drum>OK,
I really don't care what it's doing right</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/284-1
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.932
<v John Drum>now.
I'm just defining what it needs to do in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/283-0
00:24:41.648 --> 00:24:43.688
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/284-2
00:24:42.932 --> 00:24:43.488
<v John Drum>the future.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/285-0
00:24:44.848 --> 00:24:47.688
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>We need to move that somewhere else.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/288-0
00:24:45.328 --> 00:24:48.988
<v John Drum>That what happens,
what we're doing now is when we go to the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/288-1
00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:52.888
<v John Drum>migration of the data that we have now to
what it's going to be,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/288-2
00:24:52.888 --> 00:24:57.628
<v John Drum>then we'll have to figure out how to
transform that data into the the new look</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/288-3
00:24:57.628 --> 00:24:59.368
<v John Drum>and feel of these new tables.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/286-0
00:24:57.928 --> 00:24:58.408
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/287-0
00:25:00.608 --> 00:25:01.648
<v Cyrus Bajracharya>OK, understood.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/289-0
00:25:03.288 --> 00:25:06.895
<v John Drum>But if we don't have the structure
correct for the new platform,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/289-1
00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:10.668
<v John Drum>that transformation piece is going to be
a nightmare. So as I said,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/289-2
00:25:10.668 --> 00:25:14.553
<v John Drum>this document journal Ledger,
it's going to be a common Ledger that's</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/289-3
00:25:14.553 --> 00:25:17.549
<v John Drum>shared by all of those systems and that's
the Ledger.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/289-4
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:20.768
<v John Drum>This is the item also that we're talking
about, you know?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/290-0
00:25:21.328 --> 00:25:26.228
<v John Drum>When everything is dropping event status
updates to the topic that updates,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/290-1
00:25:26.228 --> 00:25:31.128
<v John Drum>this Ledger should have an entry for
everything that gets dropped in there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/291-0
00:25:32.768 --> 00:25:35.286
<v John Drum>You know,
it may also update some other tables,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/291-1
00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:38.328
<v John Drum>but there should always be a journal
entry, Ledger entry.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/292-0
00:25:40.328 --> 00:25:40.728
<v John Drum>Every time.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/293-0
00:25:43.368 --> 00:25:44.968
<v John Drum>Just as an FYI.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/295-0
00:25:46.168 --> 00:25:50.941
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So the journal entry would be originate
from this table, right John?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/295-1
00:25:50.941 --> 00:25:55.368
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>This is the origin of this the one which
we are using in proxy.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/294-0
00:25:50.968 --> 00:25:52.408
<v John Drum>Which table is this?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/297-0
00:25:56.648 --> 00:26:02.048
<v John Drum>OK, this is for the initial. OK,
So what was your question?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/296-0
00:25:58.688 --> 00:25:58.968
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/302-0
00:26:01.568 --> 00:26:07.456
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So this this is the one originating this
particular journal ID and from there</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/299-0
00:26:06.568 --> 00:26:06.688
<v John Drum>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/302-1
00:26:07.456 --> 00:26:12.739
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>we'll be appending this tables for that
particular journal ID, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/300-0
00:26:11.928 --> 00:26:12.368
<v John Drum>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/302-2
00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:15.608
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Keep on adding. OK so but this is for.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/301-0
00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:18.008
<v John Drum>There should be a correlation ID in there
too, but I don't see it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/303-0
00:26:18.248 --> 00:26:18.368
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/304-0
00:26:20.768 --> 00:26:22.008
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Correlation on UK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/305-0
00:26:27.408 --> 00:26:31.219
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So OK,
so but there would be multiple entries</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/305-1
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:38.096
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>right for or different types of requests
like for getting the uploading a document</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/305-2
00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:42.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>that that will hit the document hub
directly, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/307-0
00:26:43.608 --> 00:26:51.288
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So how so so would that put a information
here in this table and then start?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/306-0
00:26:44.368 --> 00:26:45.048
<v John Drum>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/309-0
00:26:50.128 --> 00:26:53.121
<v John Drum>Well,
this table you just told me was when the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/309-1
00:26:53.121 --> 00:26:54.968
<v John Drum>initial print request, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/308-0
00:26:55.608 --> 00:26:55.808
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/311-0
00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:59.888
<v John Drum>So this table doesn't get any entry in it
for a reprint.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/310-0
00:26:57.888 --> 00:26:58.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/312-0
00:27:01.248 --> 00:27:05.728
<v John Drum>Or from a document hub.
This table is only used when you render</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/312-1
00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:06.288
<v John Drum>the PDF.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/313-0
00:27:07.448 --> 00:27:08.968
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/315-0
00:27:09.888 --> 00:27:16.251
<v John Drum>Once that PDFS are rendered,
this status goes to whatever your final</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/315-1
00:27:16.251 --> 00:27:22.890
<v John Drum>status is completed, whatever.
But every single time something changes,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/314-0
00:27:16.728 --> 00:27:17.288
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/315-2
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.288
<v John Drum>you get an entry into the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/316-0
00:27:25.488 --> 00:27:26.808
<v John Drum>Journal Ledger.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/320-0
00:27:28.128 --> 00:27:33.376
<v John Drum>You know when it was submitted for print
after it was complete that then it gets</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/317-0
00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:29.208
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Sure.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/318-0
00:27:31.368 --> 00:27:31.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/320-1
00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:36.745
<v John Drum>transferred into document hub that gets a
an entry.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/320-2
00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:41.928
<v John Drum>The document hub saves that data to ECMS
that gets a journal Ledger entry then.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/319-0
00:27:37.608 --> 00:27:38.088
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/321-0
00:27:43.768 --> 00:27:49.833
<v John Drum>The value gets dropped into the topic
that gets a journal over in a journal</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/321-1
00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:56.218
<v John Drum>entry. You know every step of the way.
Think of it almost as a logger of what's</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/321-2
00:27:56.218 --> 00:28:00.608
<v John Drum>happening as a as something passes
through the system.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/322-0
00:28:00.928 --> 00:28:03.864
<v John Drum>You know,
when it gets picked up from the topic and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/322-1
00:28:03.864 --> 00:28:07.703
<v John Drum>processed, it gets a journal entry.
I should be able to use this to</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/322-2
00:28:07.703 --> 00:28:11.712
<v John Drum>troubleshoot what happened to the
document by simply going in here and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/322-3
00:28:11.712 --> 00:28:15.721
<v John Drum>looking for a given request.
What was the last step that was completed</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/322-4
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:16.568
<v John Drum>in this Ledger?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/323-0
00:28:17.088 --> 00:28:20.893
<v John Drum>I have a a very quick,
easy way to see the whole life cycle of</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/323-1
00:28:20.893 --> 00:28:24.638
<v John Drum>what happened to a either a print request,
a reprint request,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/323-2
00:28:24.638 --> 00:28:28.262
<v John Drum>or somebody just pulling something out of
the document hub.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/323-3
00:28:28.262 --> 00:28:32.248
<v John Drum>All that should be in here.
Now what I don't want to put in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/324-0
00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:36.398
<v John Drum>Is every time somebody requests something
from the document hub,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/324-1
00:28:36.398 --> 00:28:40.888
<v John Drum>but anytime something is saved to the
document hub, we will put it in there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/325-0
00:28:41.968 --> 00:28:46.363
<v John Drum>But I don't want to put the request to
retrieve anything from the document hub</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/325-1
00:28:46.363 --> 00:28:46.808
<v John Drum>in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/326-0
00:28:47.888 --> 00:28:49.248
<v John Drum>So there is that difference.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/327-0
00:28:51.048 --> 00:28:56.133
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm-hmm. But John,
we have in a requirement, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/327-1
00:28:56.133 --> 00:29:02.017
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Like for the UI shows what was the last
time that who? OK,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/327-2
00:29:02.017 --> 00:29:05.208
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>who request viewed the document?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/329-0
00:29:04.448 --> 00:29:07.644
<v John Drum>That's fine.
We're talking about creating an analytics</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/329-1
00:29:07.644 --> 00:29:09.968
<v John Drum>table for that. That doesn't go in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/328-0
00:29:07.648 --> 00:29:08.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/330-0
00:29:10.008 --> 00:29:12.048
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Doesn't worry in here, OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/331-0
00:29:13.048 --> 00:29:13.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/333-0
00:29:13.968 --> 00:29:17.159
<v John Drum>Because that if it's just the last time
it was documented,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/333-1
00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:21.377
<v John Drum>you could do an update on a column for a
given document and you don't need to</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/332-0
00:29:20.648 --> 00:29:21.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/333-2
00:29:21.377 --> 00:29:24.568
<v John Drum>create 10 million records for every time
somebody used it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/334-0
00:29:25.728 --> 00:29:29.483
<v John Drum>Because remember,
we create a new row every time we write</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/334-1
00:29:29.483 --> 00:29:30.648
<v John Drum>something to this.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/335-0
00:29:32.128 --> 00:29:35.688
<v John Drum>And every time somebody looks at a
document, I don't want to write a new row.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/337-0
00:29:39.248 --> 00:29:43.989
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm-hmm. Not in here, you're saying,
but we need to have an in the analytic</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/336-0
00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:42.248
<v John Drum>Not in this.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/338-0
00:29:43.408 --> 00:29:47.008
<v John Drum>That can be updated in a different
analytic table for that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/337-1
00:29:43.989 --> 00:29:44.368
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>build.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/339-0
00:29:46.808 --> 00:29:46.928
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/340-0
00:29:53.248 --> 00:29:57.848
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Think I have that somewhere capture that
thing, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/341-0
00:29:59.968 --> 00:30:02.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>I think this is the table energy.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/342-0
00:30:03.728 --> 00:30:05.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Document events table.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/343-0
00:30:07.208 --> 00:30:07.248
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>I.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/344-0
00:30:09.008 --> 00:30:15.504
<v John Drum>Now do you have one record in here or do
you that you keep updating or is it like</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/344-1
00:30:15.504 --> 00:30:21.128
<v John Drum>for any given document event or storage
index or you just updating it?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/345-0
00:30:21.168 --> 00:30:24.368
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Maybe Ledger kind of table like every
request to get in.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/346-0
00:30:25.768 --> 00:30:27.368
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Oh, you did that? Who created?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/348-0
00:30:30.608 --> 00:30:36.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, I think I will let your that will be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/347-0
00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:32.168
<v John Drum>So viewed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/349-0
00:30:37.848 --> 00:30:42.511
<v John Drum>So this is going to be a problem because
if you use viewed and you have a shared</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/349-1
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:47.231
<v John Drum>document, you're going to get millions,
literally millions of entries in here for</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/349-2
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:48.728
<v John Drum>viewing a shared document.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/350-0
00:30:52.928 --> 00:30:54.808
<v John Drum>If you write a record every single time
it's viewed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/353-0
00:30:58.688 --> 00:31:02.229
<v John Drum>And what would be the purpose of it?
Because what you really want to know is</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/353-1
00:31:02.229 --> 00:31:05.126
<v John Drum>who viewed it, right?
Not the fact that that document was just</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/352-0
00:31:03.848 --> 00:31:04.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/353-2
00:31:05.126 --> 00:31:05.448
<v John Drum>viewed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/355-0
00:31:06.568 --> 00:31:10.688
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah, that that would be like actor ID,
right? Who? Who gave that request?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/356-0
00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:14.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>And bugs.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/359-0
00:31:12.768 --> 00:31:17.114
<v John Drum>Well, I don't know.
I don't just see descriptions in here,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/357-0
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:16.808
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, OK. OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/359-1
00:31:17.114 --> 00:31:21.608
<v John Drum>so half the time I don't understand what
you're subtle hint.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/358-0
00:31:18.328 --> 00:31:18.368
Uh.

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/360-0
00:31:18.568 --> 00:31:22.848
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, yeah,
I didn't get a chance to do that actually.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/361-0
00:31:22.728 --> 00:31:24.608
<v Veda Behera>Yeah, you you can add a column there and.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/362-0
00:31:26.528 --> 00:31:27.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>That would be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/363-0
00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:27.288
<v John Drum>So.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/364-0
00:31:29.448 --> 00:31:30.488
<v Veda Behera>Did the things.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/365-0
00:31:31.088 --> 00:31:34.408
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So I have only three three options like 3
columns.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/366-0
00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:36.848
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>2.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/369-0
00:31:39.528 --> 00:31:42.561
<v John Drum>And if it's for the person that's doing
it,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/369-1
00:31:42.561 --> 00:31:47.869
<v John Drum>is it the customer ID you put in there?
What what information you put in the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/367-0
00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:43.608
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Hmm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/369-2
00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:51.384
<v John Drum>actor type?
Because typically a type tells me it's</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/369-3
00:31:51.384 --> 00:31:53.728
<v John Drum>like an agent customer, not their.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/368-0
00:31:52.608 --> 00:31:53.608
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Agent. Yeah, agent.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/370-0
00:31:55.648 --> 00:31:58.368
<v John Drum>OK, so if it's an agent, uh.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/372-0
00:31:59.648 --> 00:32:03.620
<v John Drum>What if it's a customer and then the if
it's if it's an agent,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/372-1
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.348
<v John Drum>you you don't know what they're what,
who they're viewing that for, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/372-2
00:32:08.348 --> 00:32:12.131
<v John Drum>And you're not going to display that for
an agent anywhere.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/371-0
00:32:09.248 --> 00:32:09.608
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/372-3
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:14.968
<v John Drum>So I'm not sure what the purpose of that
is.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/376-0
00:32:15.448 --> 00:32:19.355
<v John Drum>It only makes sense when you're talking
about for a customer.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/373-0
00:32:18.408 --> 00:32:18.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/376-1
00:32:19.355 --> 00:32:24.269
<v John Drum>So let's say it is for a customer and
then you're putting the customer ID in.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/374-0
00:32:20.328 --> 00:32:20.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/376-2
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:28.932
<v John Drum>Wouldn't you really want to do the
account because you can have different</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/375-0
00:32:24.328 --> 00:32:24.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/376-3
00:32:28.932 --> 00:32:31.768
<v John Drum>shared documents for the different
accounts.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/377-0
00:32:32.928 --> 00:32:36.703
<v John Drum>So when you're looking at it that this
customer looked at this shared document,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/377-1
00:32:36.703 --> 00:32:39.488
<v John Drum>you don't know which account it was
associated to, do you?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/378-0
00:32:41.048 --> 00:32:41.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Hmm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/379-0
00:32:42.768 --> 00:32:45.368
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah, should we go?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/380-0
00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:48.648
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Source app device OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/381-0
00:32:48.448 --> 00:32:52.888
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>But a particular document is associated
with only with a certain account, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/382-0
00:32:54.168 --> 00:32:57.084
<v John Drum>Yeah,
but you got to re re-engineer the path</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/382-1
00:32:57.084 --> 00:33:01.036
<v John Drum>that would associate it.
People use these Ledger entries for</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/382-2
00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:04.276
<v John Drum>analytics.
That's why it's in an analytics scheme</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/382-3
00:33:04.276 --> 00:33:08.488
<v John Drum>and that does that means they don't want
to have to go back and.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/383-0
00:33:08.808 --> 00:33:12.760
<v John Drum>Do some kind of algorithm to figure out
who called it. You know,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/383-1
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.077
<v John Drum>they know it was this customer,
but that customer's got five accounts.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/383-2
00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:21.637
<v John Drum>So do they they really have to go through
and figure out which account was</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/383-3
00:33:21.637 --> 00:33:24.008
<v John Drum>associated to this particular document?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/384-0
00:33:24.448 --> 00:33:27.266
<v John Drum>Or should it just say that when they're
doing their analytics?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/384-1
00:33:27.266 --> 00:33:30.488
<v John Drum>Because if you have to figure it out,
then they can't do it in a query.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/385-0
00:33:32.048 --> 00:33:34.048
<v John Drum>So their analytics has failed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/386-0
00:33:34.648 --> 00:33:34.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Oh.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/388-0
00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:38.088
<v John Drum>Without a bunch of joins for different
types of lookups.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/387-0
00:33:35.608 --> 00:33:35.928
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>On.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/391-0
00:33:38.888 --> 00:33:44.232
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>The transactional web has the requirement
even in legacy wherein they need to</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/391-1
00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:49.713
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>display the first time like the timestamp
the document was downloaded the first</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/390-0
00:33:49.608 --> 00:33:50.088
<v John Drum>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/391-2
00:33:49.713 --> 00:33:51.768
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>time or viewed the first time.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/392-0
00:33:51.328 --> 00:33:54.552
<v John Drum>And that's fine.
I'm not saying that you don't put a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/392-1
00:33:54.552 --> 00:33:57.594
<v John Drum>record in here.
All I'm saying is you have enough</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/392-2
00:33:57.594 --> 00:34:02.156
<v John Drum>information to actually retrieve it
without going out and doing a bunch of</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/392-3
00:34:02.156 --> 00:34:05.928
<v John Drum>other queries for each entry that you're
trying to pull back.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/394-0
00:34:09.168 --> 00:34:14.878
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>We could just dump if you can just,
we could just dump the request payload</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/393-0
00:34:09.808 --> 00:34:12.568
<v John Drum>So that's why the account ID is.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/394-1
00:34:14.878 --> 00:34:20.587
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>inside the event data, right? Whatever,
say what do you call fluid column.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/394-2
00:34:20.587 --> 00:34:23.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>We could add those information here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/397-0
00:34:26.288 --> 00:34:30.084
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>For any even type like who requested who,
what?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/395-0
00:34:26.328 --> 00:34:26.648
<v John Drum>For what?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/397-1
00:34:30.084 --> 00:34:33.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>What are the parameters of the payload?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/396-0
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:32.768
<v John Drum>Kemari.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/398-0
00:34:34.208 --> 00:34:38.488
<v John Drum>Sure, once you get the data back,
but that's not what analytics is used for.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/399-0
00:34:39.328 --> 00:34:42.328
<v John Drum>So let's say that the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/401-0
00:34:44.008 --> 00:34:48.728
<v John Drum>The person in that's doing this analytics
they want to see.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/400-0
00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:44.248
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>2.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/402-0
00:34:51.248 --> 00:34:53.368
<v John Drum>How many accounts and which accounts?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/403-0
00:34:54.928 --> 00:34:58.688
<v John Drum>View the disclosure for this month.
A specific disclosure.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/404-0
00:34:59.488 --> 00:34:59.928
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Hmm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/405-0
00:35:00.328 --> 00:35:02.808
<v John Drum>So the query against the um.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/406-0
00:35:05.648 --> 00:35:09.928
<v John Drum>I don't even know where you have what
they viewed is in here. Let's see.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/408-0
00:35:12.968 --> 00:35:16.808
<v John Drum>So you've got a viewed record.
How do you know what they viewed?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/407-0
00:35:14.528 --> 00:35:14.888
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/409-0
00:35:17.328 --> 00:35:21.528
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>This is the Suresh index ID, right?
So that would be the document.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/410-0
00:35:21.488 --> 00:35:24.180
<v John Drum>But that still doesn't tell them what it
is.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/410-1
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.608
<v John Drum>It just shows them is that storage index
from ECMS or is it document hub?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/411-0
00:35:29.288 --> 00:35:33.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>It's it's on the ECMS. This is the no,
this is the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/412-0
00:35:34.608 --> 00:35:36.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Storage index from here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/416-0
00:35:41.048 --> 00:35:48.105
<v John Drum>OK, so to find out what this document is,
we have to do a join from our analytics</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/416-1
00:35:48.105 --> 00:35:55.162
<v John Drum>table to our document or to our document
hub instance table to our template table</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/414-0
00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:53.088
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/415-0
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:58.328
<v Veda Behera>That will be a expensive join, John.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/416-2
00:35:55.162 --> 00:35:58.088
<v John Drum>to find out what the document was.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/418-0
00:35:58.608 --> 00:36:00.568
<v John Drum>Yeah, it's mine.
That's what I'm trying to get at.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/417-0
00:36:01.728 --> 00:36:02.528
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/419-0
00:36:03.568 --> 00:36:09.768
<v John Drum>If this is a analytic schema specifically
for documents, you should denormalize it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/424-0
00:36:11.728 --> 00:36:15.812
<v John Drum>Or am I saying that backwards?
You should put more information in here</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/420-0
00:36:11.768 --> 00:36:11.888
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/424-1
00:36:15.812 --> 00:36:20.587
<v John Drum>rather than less and put the document or
the template type at least in here so you</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/421-0
00:36:17.488 --> 00:36:17.968
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/424-2
00:36:20.587 --> 00:36:23.924
<v John Drum>know what it is.
Because you think about what what's this</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/422-0
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:21.528
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/424-3
00:36:23.924 --> 00:36:27.088
<v John Drum>table being used for?
It's being used to do analytics.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/423-0
00:36:27.168 --> 00:36:28.248
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm-hmm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/425-0
00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:32.031
<v John Drum>So that means I want to just in my where
clause for when I'm querying things,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/425-1
00:36:32.031 --> 00:36:35.009
<v John Drum>there's certain things I'm going to query
on, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/425-2
00:36:35.009 --> 00:36:39.673
<v John Drum>The whole purpose of a document is to be
able to say which document I want to look</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/425-3
00:36:39.673 --> 00:36:43.888
<v John Drum>at. So I want to define that without,
you know, joining 3 tables together.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/426-0
00:36:44.288 --> 00:36:46.160
<v John Drum>Um,
especially when they could be in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/426-1
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.728
<v John Drum>completely different databases.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/427-0
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:52.275
<v John Drum>In this case they're not,
but you know they could be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/427-1
00:36:52.275 --> 00:36:55.918
<v John Drum>So at least the things you're going to
put in your where clause,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/427-2
00:36:55.918 --> 00:36:58.048
<v John Drum>you want to put a fields in the table.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/428-0
00:37:01.088 --> 00:37:03.528
<v John Drum>And that way your your query is a lot
less expensive.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/429-0
00:37:03.848 --> 00:37:04.408
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/430-0
00:37:05.008 --> 00:37:06.328
<v John Drum>Am I?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/432-0
00:37:08.048 --> 00:37:12.208
<v John Drum>I mean, I'm not a database designer,
but this just makes sense to me.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/431-0
00:37:12.808 --> 00:37:13.088
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/435-0
00:37:13.968 --> 00:37:17.451
<v John Drum>So you have an event type, which is good.
You say viewed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/435-1
00:37:17.451 --> 00:37:22.076
<v John Drum>Now you have an account ID in there.
So you have what account it belongs to.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/435-2
00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:24.959
<v John Drum>Then you should have some kind of,
like I said,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/433-0
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:23.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/435-3
00:37:24.959 --> 00:37:29.704
<v John Drum>that identifies because the instance
record doesn't tell you what the document</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/435-4
00:37:29.704 --> 00:37:33.728
<v John Drum>was. It's the template that it belongs to,
right? Should there be?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/434-0
00:37:33.848 --> 00:37:34.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/441-0
00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:38.459
<v John Drum>So there should be some kind of field
from the template that gets put in here</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/436-0
00:37:38.128 --> 00:37:38.648
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/441-1
00:37:38.459 --> 00:37:41.330
<v John Drum>to say what this is. Like,
was this a statement?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/437-0
00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:41.088
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/441-2
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.022
<v John Drum>Was it a shared document? You know,
was it a regular document?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/438-0
00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:44.208
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/441-3
00:37:45.022 --> 00:37:47.601
<v John Drum>You got to have enough information in
here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/439-0
00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:47.048
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/441-4
00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:50.414
<v John Drum>We're going to make a table and put data
in it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/441-5
00:37:50.414 --> 00:37:53.168
<v John Drum>You got to have enough data to make it
useful.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/440-0
00:37:53.608 --> 00:37:54.008
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/442-0
00:37:58.248 --> 00:38:00.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, I think. Mm-hmm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/443-0
00:37:58.688 --> 00:38:02.063
<v John Drum>That's all I'm saying.
And you got to think about that a little</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/443-1
00:38:02.063 --> 00:38:04.490
<v John Drum>bit.
How is this going to be used in a query?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/443-2
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.648
<v John Drum>So.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/447-0
00:38:05.808 --> 00:38:08.139
<v John Drum>This,
this is the reason I wanted to review</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/447-1
00:38:08.139 --> 00:38:12.271
<v John Drum>these tables because because a lot of
times I think we just sit down and say,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/444-0
00:38:08.968 --> 00:38:09.568
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/447-2
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:14.655
<v John Drum>OK,
let's slap together something real quick</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/447-3
00:38:14.655 --> 00:38:17.145
<v John Drum>and without really analyzing what we're
doing.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/447-4
00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:20.695
<v John Drum>So this is used specifically for
analytics that they're using for,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/445-0
00:38:19.968 --> 00:38:20.008
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>I.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/447-5
00:38:20.695 --> 00:38:23.768
<v John Drum>you know, back office, the website,
things like that, so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/446-0
00:38:21.728 --> 00:38:21.848
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/449-0
00:38:25.248 --> 00:38:28.612
<v John Drum>You got to put the information in here
that can easily be retrieved.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/449-1
00:38:28.612 --> 00:38:31.829
<v John Drum>Because also you got to remember if this
is going on the website,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/449-2
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:33.974
<v John Drum>if you're retrieving information from
here,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/449-3
00:38:33.974 --> 00:38:36.168
<v John Drum>you don't want that query to take 5
minutes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/448-0
00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:37.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/450-0
00:38:39.048 --> 00:38:41.328
<v John Drum>It needs to happen pretty quick.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/451-0
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:48.391
<v John Drum>And without the proper fields to query
against and the proper indexes,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/451-1
00:38:48.391 --> 00:38:50.808
<v John Drum>that's just not going to happen so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/453-0
00:39:04.288 --> 00:39:07.516
<v John Drum>So let's add,
go ahead and think about this table for a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/453-1
00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:10.456
<v John Drum>little bit.
I just want you guys to go through the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/453-2
00:39:10.456 --> 00:39:13.454
<v John Drum>exercise.
If you were going to use this table to do</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/452-0
00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:11.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/453-3
00:39:13.454 --> 00:39:17.720
<v John Drum>reporting or information on stuff,
what fields would you need in there so</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/453-4
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.448
<v John Drum>that if you didn't have any other tables
to go against and you only had this one?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/455-0
00:39:23.168 --> 00:39:25.008
<v John Drum>What would you need to do to do that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/454-0
00:39:26.008 --> 00:39:26.248
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/457-0
00:39:27.728 --> 00:39:32.235
<v John Drum>And then I'll just review that because I
still think there's a couple of things</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/457-1
00:39:32.235 --> 00:39:32.968
<v John Drum>missing here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/456-0
00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:33.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/458-0
00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:38.991
<v John Drum>But I want you guys to go through that
exercise because I'm not going to be here</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/458-1
00:39:38.991 --> 00:39:43.066
<v John Drum>forever to do this for you.
So you guys need to start thinking along</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/458-2
00:39:43.066 --> 00:39:46.727
<v John Drum>this way to say, OK,
if I'm creating this and this is part of</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/458-3
00:39:46.727 --> 00:39:50.448
<v John Drum>our platform and people from all
different areas like risk or.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/459-0
00:39:50.448 --> 00:39:56.263
<v John Drum>Data warehouse or you know the business
people and they want to analyze this data.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/459-1
00:39:56.263 --> 00:40:01.448
<v John Drum>What kind of data do I need to put in
here and then how do they query it?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/460-0
00:40:04.888 --> 00:40:09.452
<v John Drum>Because this has a different purpose than
our other Ledger,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/460-1
00:40:09.452 --> 00:40:15.842
<v John Drum>our our other journal Ledger that lets us
track the beginning to the end life cycle</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/460-2
00:40:15.842 --> 00:40:17.288
<v John Drum>of a given request.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/461-0
00:40:18.688 --> 00:40:21.834
<v John Drum>This is specific types of things that
you're doing for,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/461-1
00:40:21.834 --> 00:40:25.093
<v John Drum>and that other one is not for analytics
either. It's not.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/461-2
00:40:25.093 --> 00:40:29.082
<v John Drum>It could be used for analytics,
but it's not really designed for that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/461-3
00:40:29.082 --> 00:40:33.520
<v John Drum>This you're saying you're specifically
designing this for analytics for people</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/461-4
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.768
<v John Drum>to do reporting on it to get statistics.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/462-0
00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:38.298
<v John Drum>Right.
When was the first time something</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/462-1
00:40:38.298 --> 00:40:41.517
<v John Drum>happened?
When was the last time something happened?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/462-2
00:40:41.517 --> 00:40:46.497
<v John Drum>How many times did it happen? You know,
that's what your different view types and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/462-3
00:40:46.497 --> 00:40:47.408
<v John Drum>stuff would be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/463-0
00:40:48.688 --> 00:40:52.073
<v John Drum>And for is it for a given person or is it
just for a given document type?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/463-1
00:40:52.073 --> 00:40:55.505
<v John Drum>Like if I just want to know how many
people went out and viewed statements</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/463-2
00:40:55.505 --> 00:40:56.008
<v John Drum>this month?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/464-0
00:40:57.648 --> 00:41:00.397
<v John Drum>Was it 10 or was it a 10 million?
You know,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/464-1
00:41:00.397 --> 00:41:05.333
<v John Drum>I should be able to just come in here and
say I want to see a document type of</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/464-2
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:10.519
<v John Drum>statements and then give it a time range
from your event time stamp and then get a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/464-3
00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:13.768
<v John Drum>count back for viewed event type and then
get that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/465-0
00:41:13.968 --> 00:41:14.808
<v John Drum>You know, count.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/467-0
00:41:16.288 --> 00:41:19.512
<v John Drum>Or I might want to say, oh,
how many times did, you know,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/467-1
00:41:19.512 --> 00:41:23.793
<v John Drum>Joe Dawson go out and view his statements?
You know, seven times this month.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/467-2
00:41:23.793 --> 00:41:27.684
<v John Drum>He must be nervous for some reason.
He keeps checking his statements.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/467-3
00:41:27.684 --> 00:41:31.965
<v John Drum>Maybe he's got an ambitious wife and
she's going out and charging everything</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/467-4
00:41:31.965 --> 00:41:32.688
<v John Drum>all the time.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/468-0
00:41:32.808 --> 00:41:37.128
<v John Drum>So he's he's trying to see what she's
charging. So you know.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/469-0
00:41:38.368 --> 00:41:38.488
So.

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/470-0
00:41:38.528 --> 00:41:41.128
<v John Drum>We need that kind of information in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/472-0
00:41:40.928 --> 00:41:45.741
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>So one more question.
So we don't need any counter columns in</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/472-1
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:49.467
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>here, right?
Something that keeps incrementing,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/474-0
00:41:48.608 --> 00:41:51.600
<v John Drum>Account.
If you're gonna if it's on Ledger and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/472-2
00:41:49.467 --> 00:41:51.408
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>no counter, some sort of.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/474-1
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.248
<v John Drum>you're putting an entry in here,
then you can just do a count on the Um.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/473-0
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:55.368
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/475-0
00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.568
<v John Drum>On the number of rows for that view type.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/476-0
00:41:59.888 --> 00:42:04.381
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>But earlier you had this,
I mean like a while back you mentioned</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/476-1
00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:10.187
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>there might also be this concern where in
this table might get really bloated up if</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/476-2
00:42:10.187 --> 00:42:15.026
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>we were to record each each time a
document is viewed by a particular</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/476-3
00:42:15.026 --> 00:42:15.648
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>customer.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/478-0
00:42:16.048 --> 00:42:18.799
<v John Drum>Yes,
when you when you're when you're not</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/477-0
00:42:16.648 --> 00:42:16.928
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>And.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/478-1
00:42:18.799 --> 00:42:20.568
<v John Drum>putting the customer in it.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-0
00:42:21.648 --> 00:42:23.970
<v John Drum>But if you're going to put the customer
in it,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-1
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:27.724
<v John Drum>then that data now makes sense before
just putting something that's viewed,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-2
00:42:27.724 --> 00:42:29.947
<v John Drum>but you don't know who it's being viewed
by.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-3
00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:32.862
<v John Drum>It makes no sense to just keep writing a
bunch of records.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-4
00:42:32.862 --> 00:42:36.764
<v John Drum>It's not that I was trying to say that
what I was trying to get at is it's not</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-5
00:42:36.764 --> 00:42:40.370
<v John Drum>that that information is not helpful,
but you need to make it so that it</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/479-6
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.408
<v John Drum>actually makes sense.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/480-0
00:42:41.528 --> 00:42:47.672
<v John Drum>So if if you're just going to say that
somebody viewed this, and it was 10,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/480-1
00:42:47.672 --> 00:42:53.331
<v John Drum>000 times, that's useless.
Other for except very niche type of query.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/480-2
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:56.808
<v John Drum>It's more saying, okay,
I want to know who</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/481-0
00:42:57.168 --> 00:43:01.368
<v John Drum>Viewed their statements this month.
Return me a list of which accounts.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/482-0
00:43:03.928 --> 00:43:10.264
<v John Drum>Now you can actually go in there and from
the viewed entries say OK for each person</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/482-1
00:43:10.264 --> 00:43:16.449
<v John Drum>these are the persons and then for each
person they had five views or three views</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/482-2
00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:17.128
<v John Drum>you know.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/483-0
00:43:19.328 --> 00:43:20.688
<v John Drum>And it's.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/484-0
00:43:22.288 --> 00:43:26.455
<v John Drum>It becomes a little bit more problematic
if they want to say, OK,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/484-1
00:43:26.455 --> 00:43:30.749
<v John Drum>if they have 10 statements,
which statement did they view that many</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/484-2
00:43:30.749 --> 00:43:33.716
<v John Drum>times?
This said this Ledger doesn't have that</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/484-3
00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:37.568
<v John Drum>information in it,
but I don't know that that's necessarily.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/485-0
00:43:37.568 --> 00:43:42.024
<v John Drum>Needed either at that point,
because I can't imagine any statistical</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/485-1
00:43:42.024 --> 00:43:44.608
<v John Drum>query that they would need to know that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/486-0
00:43:52.368 --> 00:43:56.681
<v John Drum>So that's an action item.
I want you guys to think about what</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/486-1
00:43:56.681 --> 00:44:00.368
<v John Drum>should be in here,
which columns need to be indexed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/487-0
00:44:04.128 --> 00:44:10.456
<v John Drum>And if you're going to partition this
table, say, let's only keep, uh let's say,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/487-1
00:44:10.456 --> 00:44:14.128
<v John Drum>a year's worth of data,
how would you do that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/488-0
00:44:15.568 --> 00:44:17.928
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Would be on even time step.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/489-0
00:44:19.608 --> 00:44:20.168
<v John Drum>What's that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/491-0
00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:25.008
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Even timestamp like when the when the
records were created like.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/492-0
00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:29.019
<v John Drum>Okay.
But let's say that you have an event</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/492-1
00:44:29.019 --> 00:44:34.554
<v John Drum>timestamp.
But there were thirty records written for</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/492-2
00:44:34.554 --> 00:44:35.808
<v John Drum>that that um</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/494-0
00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:41.698
<v John Drum>Well, I guess that doesn't matter.
You can just use the event timestamp.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/494-1
00:44:41.698 --> 00:44:45.748
<v John Drum>So you can have a partition on the event
timestamp and then when you go to,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/494-2
00:44:45.748 --> 00:44:49.585
<v John Drum>let's say it's a month partition,
you got to be careful because I don't</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/494-3
00:44:49.585 --> 00:44:53.742
<v John Drum>know if you can do a your event timestamp
actually goes out to the minute and</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/494-4
00:44:53.742 --> 00:44:54.488
<v John Drum>second, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/493-0
00:44:54.528 --> 00:44:54.808
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/496-0
00:44:55.008 --> 00:44:59.655
<v John Drum>But when you're doing a partition,
you typically only do it down to the date</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/496-1
00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:03.336
<v John Drum>level, not the time.
So you may you have to check to see if.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/496-2
00:45:03.336 --> 00:45:08.285
<v John Drum>I don't know if you can do a partition on
just the date part of a date time stamp</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/496-3
00:45:08.285 --> 00:45:11.122
<v John Drum>field.
You may have to have another date field</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/496-4
00:45:11.122 --> 00:45:12.208
<v John Drum>in here somewhere.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/495-0
00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:13.648
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/497-0
00:45:14.848 --> 00:45:18.583
<v John Drum>You might be able to.
I just don't know off the top of my head</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/497-1
00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:22.081
<v John Drum>if you can or not.
I don't know enough about partitions to</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/497-2
00:45:22.081 --> 00:45:25.164
<v John Drum>say that,
but the easiest way to do mass operations</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/497-3
00:45:25.164 --> 00:45:29.729
<v John Drum>against tables and not affect their
operation is to put partitions in and by</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/497-4
00:45:29.729 --> 00:45:31.448
<v John Drum>partitioning against a month.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/499-0
00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:35.619
<v John Drum>For a bunch of records, you can just say,
OK,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/499-1
00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:40.609
<v John Drum>I want to go through and delete all the
records, you know,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/499-2
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:45.008
<v John Drum>past November of 2023 and it'll just drop
them all.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/498-0
00:45:41.528 --> 00:45:42.008
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/500-0
00:45:45.648 --> 00:45:47.328
<v John Drum>Regardless of all the other fields.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/501-0
00:45:48.688 --> 00:45:49.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/503-0
00:45:48.928 --> 00:45:51.883
<v John Drum>Yes, it's this is a Ledger table.
It's another one that will grow very</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/503-1
00:45:51.883 --> 00:45:53.964
<v John Drum>quickly,
so we have to have a way to manage it so</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/503-2
00:45:53.964 --> 00:45:55.088
<v John Drum>it just doesn't go forever.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/502-0
00:45:57.128 --> 00:45:57.248
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/504-0
00:45:59.248 --> 00:46:01.909
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah,
I think we can have for if you are</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/504-1
00:46:01.909 --> 00:46:06.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>planning to have a partition in it month
or year, we could have.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/505-0
00:46:07.608 --> 00:46:10.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Anthony error column, something like that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/509-0
00:46:11.088 --> 00:46:13.551
<v John Drum>I would,
I would probably actually talk to a</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/509-1
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:17.219
<v John Drum>database architect and get some advice on
the best way to do that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/506-0
00:46:15.688 --> 00:46:18.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Huh. OK, OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/509-2
00:46:17.219 --> 00:46:19.738
<v John Drum>We don't have to invent everything
ourselves,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/509-3
00:46:19.738 --> 00:46:22.968
<v John Drum>but we should use resources to come up
with those designs.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/507-0
00:46:19.928 --> 00:46:20.168
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Sure.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/508-0
00:46:24.328 --> 00:46:24.888
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Sure.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/511-0
00:46:28.848 --> 00:46:34.054
<v John Drum>But I do expect you guys to think through
the scenarios to say what information we</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/510-0
00:46:31.848 --> 00:46:32.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/511-1
00:46:34.054 --> 00:46:34.368
<v John Drum>need.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/512-0
00:46:36.928 --> 00:46:42.440
<v John Drum>And create descriptions and the data
dictionaries with entity diagrams for all</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/512-1
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.208
<v John Drum>this stuff.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/513-0
00:46:45.688 --> 00:46:48.293
<v John Drum>Otherwise,
you guys are still going to try to go</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/513-1
00:46:48.293 --> 00:46:52.599
<v John Drum>through recordings from six months ago in
the future when I'm gone to figure out</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/513-2
00:46:52.599 --> 00:46:53.928
<v John Drum>what everything is doing.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/515-0
00:46:54.928 --> 00:46:58.546
<v John Drum>If we document it correctly,
anybody can come in and look at this</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/515-1
00:46:58.546 --> 00:47:02.932
<v John Drum>table designs with the data or the data
descriptions and stuff and know exactly</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/515-2
00:47:02.932 --> 00:47:04.248
<v John Drum>how everything operates.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/514-0
00:47:04.608 --> 00:47:05.128
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Mhm.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/517-0
00:47:07.688 --> 00:47:11.414
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, John,
another thing we want to discuss is</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/516-0
00:47:09.448 --> 00:47:09.968
<v John Drum>Sure.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/517-1
00:47:11.414 --> 00:47:17.328
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>yesterday me and Sai were looking at the
UI. Sai, do you have that open?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/518-0
00:47:18.848 --> 00:47:22.568
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, I'll let me open this.
See if I it would log in here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/519-0
00:47:23.528 --> 00:47:26.648
<v John Drum>Got 10 minutes guys and I got another
meeting I gotta jump to so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/521-0
00:47:27.608 --> 00:47:29.608
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Oh, here you are.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/520-0
00:47:27.648 --> 00:47:28.928
<v John Drum>Hopefully we can get through that.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/522-0
00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:31.848
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>I'll I'll share the payload just one
second.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/523-0
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:41.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Have the.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/524-0
00:47:42.528 --> 00:47:44.088
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yes, one moment.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/525-0
00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:50.288
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yeah, or probably, yeah, just OK,
try logging to one of those accounts.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/526-0
00:47:56.008 --> 00:47:56.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Still.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/527-0
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:00.648
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Statements.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/528-0
00:48:07.408 --> 00:48:07.928
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/529-0
00:48:10.328 --> 00:48:14.328
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>You go to the document statements,
create account ID.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/530-0
00:48:13.488 --> 00:48:13.768
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/531-0
00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:18.008
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Could you expand on general
communications?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/533-0
00:48:20.128 --> 00:48:22.648
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Uh, yeah. Can you please expand on that?
Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/532-0
00:48:20.368 --> 00:48:21.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/536-0
00:48:23.208 --> 00:48:26.731
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So, John, we have what? Is this the one?
Yeah,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/536-1
00:48:26.731 --> 00:48:30.705
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>general communication is at the bottom,
right? Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/534-0
00:48:27.448 --> 00:48:27.528
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>It.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/536-2
00:48:30.705 --> 00:48:35.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So we have what we called miscreant
statements as categories here.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/535-0
00:48:36.048 --> 00:48:36.888
<v John Drum>Yep, Yep.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/537-0
00:48:37.368 --> 00:48:41.305
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>And under that we have doc type as
paperless.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/537-1
00:48:41.305 --> 00:48:44.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So for paperless we are seeing multiple.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/538-0
00:48:42.888 --> 00:48:45.824
<v John Drum>Hold it, hold it.
What do you mean a document type is</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/538-1
00:48:45.824 --> 00:48:46.368
<v John Drum>paperless?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/539-0
00:48:47.368 --> 00:48:53.208
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>So as per the UI what you call
categorization, this is the type.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/540-0
00:48:54.208 --> 00:48:56.768
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yeah,
the document type is being written as</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/540-1
00:48:56.768 --> 00:48:59.328
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>paperless letter currently from legacy,
so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/541-0
00:48:58.808 --> 00:49:02.816
<v John Drum>What does that mean?
Because paperless is a option,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/541-1
00:49:02.816 --> 00:49:05.128
<v John Drum>it's it's not a document type.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/542-0
00:49:09.728 --> 00:49:14.496
<v John Drum>There is no given document that's a
paperless document unless it's designed</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/542-1
00:49:14.496 --> 00:49:16.128
<v John Drum>to never, ever be printed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/543-0
00:49:18.168 --> 00:49:19.688
<v John Drum>Which was the document?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/545-0
00:49:22.648 --> 00:49:27.286
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>So if you look here right,
we have two HTML letters names right</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/545-1
00:49:27.286 --> 00:49:31.128
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>FF083 and if you can Scroll down we also
have FF518.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/544-0
00:49:30.688 --> 00:49:31.928
<v John Drum>FF 083.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/546-0
00:49:31.408 --> 00:49:36.621
<v Veda Behera>And they are the latest John,
which are like AEM generates on the fly</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/547-0
00:49:36.608 --> 00:49:40.654
<v John Drum>I under. I understand that,
but they can also be printed too, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/546-1
00:49:36.621 --> 00:49:38.408
<v Veda Behera>from the template, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/547-1
00:49:40.654 --> 00:49:43.879
<v John Drum>Because you're going to LPS to pull out
those letters,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/547-2
00:49:43.879 --> 00:49:48.335
<v John Drum>and the fact that they're enrolled in
paperless just means it showed in the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/547-3
00:49:48.335 --> 00:49:51.208
<v John Drum>document area,
but it could actually be printed.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/548-0
00:49:53.568 --> 00:49:58.098
<v John Drum>That's why I'm saying something this this
is screwed up because it shouldn't be</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/548-1
00:49:58.098 --> 00:50:01.326
<v John Drum>returning the type as paperless.
The it's not paperless,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/548-2
00:50:01.326 --> 00:50:05.460
<v John Drum>they're enrolled in paperless.
So we're pulling the values for those LPS</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/548-3
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.688
<v John Drum>letters, the variables,
so they can be displayed as PDF.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/549-0
00:50:09.168 --> 00:50:14.755
<v John Drum>But the type is not paperless,
so whatever's in the legacy system that's</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/549-1
00:50:14.755 --> 00:50:17.128
<v John Drum>returning that is is incorrect.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/551-0
00:50:20.048 --> 00:50:22.168
<v John Drum>Because what does it mean?
It means nothing.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/550-0
00:50:20.528 --> 00:50:20.848
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>S.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/553-0
00:50:23.328 --> 00:50:28.645
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>So one question so so the letter FF083
right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/553-1
00:50:28.645 --> 00:50:37.430
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>And the FF518V V 001 so those so those
would be would belong to a different</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/552-0
00:50:32.608 --> 00:50:33.048
<v John Drum>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/553-2
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.048
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>document type.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/554-0
00:50:39.288 --> 00:50:39.448
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Type.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/556-0
00:50:41.168 --> 00:50:45.287
<v John Drum>Well, in this particular case,
I imagine they probably reference the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/556-1
00:50:45.287 --> 00:50:49.048
<v John Drum>HTML template that you're using to
generate the letter, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/555-0
00:50:49.568 --> 00:50:50.208
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/557-0
00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:55.128
<v Veda Behera>These are the letters which you you
worked on, Sai.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/559-0
00:50:56.168 --> 00:51:00.744
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>No, right.
So when we're trying to map this to</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/559-1
00:51:00.744 --> 00:51:03.568
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>document hub, right? So each.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/562-0
00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:10.228
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>So each category and document type would
be at least as per the current definition.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/560-0
00:51:05.408 --> 00:51:05.888
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Each.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/562-1
00:51:10.228 --> 00:51:15.046
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Each each document type would be
associated with one with a particular</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/562-2
00:51:15.046 --> 00:51:18.846
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>template, right?
But yesterday when we're going by this</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/561-0
00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:18.368
<v John Drum>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/562-3
00:51:18.846 --> 00:51:23.528
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>definition, like you know,
just seeing how it's currently in legacy.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/564-0
00:51:23.808 --> 00:51:27.398
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>It it looked like one document type at
least.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/564-1
00:51:27.398 --> 00:51:33.565
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>I mean you mentioned it's incorrect,
but one one document type having multiple</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/564-2
00:51:33.565 --> 00:51:38.248
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>templates, right?
In this case it would be FF083 and FF518.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/563-0
00:51:38.688 --> 00:51:38.808
<v John Drum>So.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/565-0
00:51:38.968 --> 00:51:41.888
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>So will there be a case like that?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/567-0
00:51:41.368 --> 00:51:44.758
<v John Drum>Let me let me explain what's going to
happen.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/567-1
00:51:44.758 --> 00:51:50.286
<v John Drum>So the reason this even came about is
because the legacy system used those</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/567-2
00:51:50.286 --> 00:51:55.887
<v John Drum>bloody HTML letters for some of the
letters to be displayed in the document</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/567-3
00:51:55.887 --> 00:51:58.688
<v John Drum>or document message center in the web.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/568-0
00:51:59.608 --> 00:52:02.848
<v John Drum>The new platform that's going away.
Everything is a PDF.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/569-0
00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:09.845
<v John Drum>And we have an interim solution in there
that can still go back and pull the</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/569-1
00:52:09.845 --> 00:52:13.193
<v John Drum>values from LPS to create a PDF.
But in the future,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/569-2
00:52:13.193 --> 00:52:16.928
<v John Drum>when it's all on the new platform,
there will be no HTML.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/571-0
00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:23.537
<v John Drum>Letters. It's all going to be a PDF.
So you're not going to have these HTML</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/571-1
00:52:23.537 --> 00:52:28.553
<v John Drum>letter names. There will be no HTML.
It's only going to be the letter,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/571-2
00:52:28.553 --> 00:52:31.733
<v John Drum>and that'll be the document type,
basically.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/571-3
00:52:31.733 --> 00:52:34.488
<v John Drum>Now we have an interim problem because.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/570-0
00:52:32.328 --> 00:52:32.408
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Um.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/572-0
00:52:35.168 --> 00:52:38.934
<v John Drum>We still have some of these that are LPS
that haven't been generated with a new</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/572-1
00:52:38.934 --> 00:52:39.688
<v John Drum>platform, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/573-0
00:52:41.088 --> 00:52:47.286
<v John Drum>O that format that says HTML,
what's the other value that it could be</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/573-1
00:52:47.286 --> 00:52:48.968
<v John Drum>to say PDF or what?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/575-0
00:52:51.928 --> 00:52:54.648
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, format. You're saying format using.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/574-0
00:52:52.368 --> 00:52:53.288
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yes, it can be.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/576-0
00:52:56.688 --> 00:52:58.608
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah, we did. We did.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/577-0
00:52:56.928 --> 00:53:00.888
<v John Drum>Yeah, what's this?
So you have PDF or you have HTML, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/578-0
00:53:02.848 --> 00:53:05.033
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah,
that's the that's the tool which we are</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/578-1
00:53:05.033 --> 00:53:05.888
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>seeing here, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/579-0
00:53:05.888 --> 00:53:09.978
<v John Drum>So for when it's PDF,
that would be the regular document name,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/579-1
00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:10.368
<v John Drum>right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/582-0
00:53:11.568 --> 00:53:16.702
<v John Drum>They're document type. Excuse me,
you you're scrolling way faster than I</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/580-0
00:53:13.528 --> 00:53:13.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/581-0
00:53:15.448 --> 00:53:17.488
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Oh, oh, sorry. OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/582-1
00:53:16.702 --> 00:53:20.008
<v John Drum>can follow. You're making my stomach sick,
so.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/584-0
00:53:20.408 --> 00:53:24.208
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK, cardholder agreement type is.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/583-0
00:53:21.608 --> 00:53:21.728
<v John Drum>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/587-0
00:53:23.328 --> 00:53:28.073
<v John Drum>And then HTML letter name is null for
those types that are PDF.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/585-0
00:53:26.768 --> 00:53:26.888
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/587-1
00:53:28.073 --> 00:53:33.634
<v John Drum>So for the ones that are format HTML,
you have an HTML letter name, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/587-2
00:53:33.634 --> 00:53:35.488
<v John Drum>They go sort of together.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/586-0
00:53:35.288 --> 00:53:35.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/588-0
00:53:37.448 --> 00:53:38.408
<v John Drum>Now.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/589-0
00:53:39.648 --> 00:53:42.568
<v John Drum>Do all your HTML say paperless?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/590-0
00:53:43.968 --> 00:53:46.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>This one is paperless, yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/591-0
00:53:45.968 --> 00:53:52.121
<v John Drum>I imagine all the HTML was what paper was
right because you can only see the HTML</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/591-1
00:53:52.121 --> 00:53:56.248
<v John Drum>ones on the message or the document
center in the web.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/592-0
00:53:59.488 --> 00:54:01.448
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah, looks like it, yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/593-0
00:54:03.208 --> 00:54:08.304
<v John Drum>So basically that type is worthless
because it it means the same thing as</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/593-1
00:54:08.304 --> 00:54:08.648
<v John Drum>HTML.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/594-0
00:54:10.768 --> 00:54:15.163
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>We have OK for PDFS we do have has
stimulated name. Oh no,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/594-1
00:54:15.163 --> 00:54:16.728
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>it's not always null.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/595-0
00:54:16.608 --> 00:54:20.128
<v John Drum>Why would you have an HTML letter name
for a PDF?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/596-0
00:54:23.648 --> 00:54:27.552
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>And that's how currently, uh,
that's how currently the information</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/597-0
00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:30.088
<v Veda Behera>And that that's not used actually.
That might be, you know, like.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/596-1
00:54:27.552 --> 00:54:28.368
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>we're getting.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/598-0
00:54:32.368 --> 00:54:36.808
<v Veda Behera>Wrongly mapped. Is it used?
Is that property HTML returning?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/599-0
00:54:41.488 --> 00:54:44.807
<v Veda Behera>Or is this a shared?
This might be a shared document as well.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/599-1
00:54:44.807 --> 00:54:44.968
<v Veda Behera>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/600-0
00:54:46.128 --> 00:54:47.608
<v Veda Behera>So this doesn't have ID.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/605-0
00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:55.344
<v John Drum>So I got to go for another meeting guys,
but I want to revisit this because I</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/601-0
00:54:49.968 --> 00:54:50.248
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yes.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/605-1
00:54:55.344 --> 00:55:00.028
<v John Drum>think this is important.
So let's set up another meeting sometime</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/602-0
00:54:57.408 --> 00:54:57.528
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>OK.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/605-2
00:55:00.028 --> 00:55:05.706
<v John Drum>in the future and we'll start here and
continue because this is a bit of a mess</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/603-0
00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:03.248
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Surely.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/605-3
00:55:05.706 --> 00:55:08.048
<v John Drum>and we need to straighten it out.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/604-0
00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:07.688
<v Taher Ghulam Mohammed>Yeah.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/607-0
00:55:08.928 --> 00:55:12.577
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Yes, yeah.
We wanted to understand like how when</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/607-1
00:55:12.577 --> 00:55:18.834
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>we're storing those HTML templates right
in document help, like what would they be?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/607-2
00:55:18.834 --> 00:55:24.048
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Would they be mapped to certain document
type category or would they?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/606-0
00:55:19.088 --> 00:55:19.928
<v John Drum>Yeah, there's.</v>

00:55:23.808 --> 00:55:27.296
<v John Drum>That's just it.
Document hub won't have any HTML</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/608-0
00:55:24.048 --> 00:55:26.048
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>Be like some stand alone documents.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/609-1
00:55:27.296 --> 00:55:28.008
<v John Drum>templates.</v>

00:55:30.648 --> 00:55:32.328
<v John Drum>Because we only store.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/611-0
00:55:33.488 --> 00:55:37.734
<v John Drum>Letters in there, not HTML.
I take that back there.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/611-1
00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:43.287
<v John Drum>There could be HTML or even XML in there,
but it won't be a letter.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/611-2
00:55:43.287 --> 00:55:47.288
<v John Drum>It could be an e-mail or it could be some
other.</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/612-0
00:55:46.048 --> 00:55:48.920
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>But we'll be storing,
but in the other tables,</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/612-1
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.687
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>like in the template definition tables,
we would be storing the HTML that was</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/612-2
00:55:53.687 --> 00:55:58.088
<v Sai Krishnam Raju Potturi>used to actually render the document in
the storage index table, right?</v>

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/615-0
00:55:55.328 --> 00:55:58.390
<v John Drum>Right.

a24af1ca-382d-43ae-809f-8701819ac378/615-1
00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:02.473
<v John Drum>Yes, we talked about that the other day.
But like I said, guys,</v>
